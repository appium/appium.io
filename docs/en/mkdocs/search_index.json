Projects like \nApache Cordova\n\nor \nPhonegap\n make it easy to build apps using web\ntechnologies that are then bundled into a native wrapper, creating a hybrid app.\n\n\nImportantly, Appium is \"cross-platform\": it allows you to write tests against\nmultiple platforms (iOS, Android, Windows), using the same API. This enables\ncode reuse between iOS, Android, and Windows testsuites.\n\n\nFor specific information about what it means for Appium to \"support\" its\nplatforms, and automation modalities, please see the \nplatform support\ndoc\n.\n\n\nAppium Philosophy\n\n\nAppium was designed to meet mobile automation needs according to a philosophy\noutlined by the following four tenets:\n\n\n\n\nYou shouldn't have to recompile your app or modify it in any way in order to\n   automate it.\n\n\nYou shouldn't be locked into a specific language or framework to write and\n   run your tests.\n\n\nA mobile automation framework shouldn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to\n   automation APIs.\n\n\nA mobile automation framework should be open source, in spirit and practice\n   as well as in name!\n\n\n\n\nAppium Design\n\n\nSo how does the structure of the Appium project live out this philosophy? We\nmeet requirement #1 by using vendor-provided automation frameworks under the\nhood. That way, we don't need to compile in any Appium-specific or third-party\ncode or frameworks to your app. This means \nyou're testing the same app you're\nshipping\n. The vendor-provided frameworks we use are:\n\n\n\n\niOS 9.3 and above: Apple's \nXCUITest\n\n\niOS 9.3 and lower: Apple's \nUIAutomation\n\n\nAndroid 4.2+: Google's \nUiAutomator/UiAutomator2\n\n\nAndroid 2.3+: Google's \nInstrumentation\n. (Instrumentation support is provided by bundling a separate project, \nSelendroid\n)\n\n\nWindows: Microsoft's \nWinAppDriver\n\n\n\n\nWe meet requirement #2 by wrapping the vendor-provided frameworks in one API,\nthe \nWebDriver\n API.\nWebDriver (aka \"Selenium WebDriver\") specifies a client-server protocol\n(known as the \nJSON Wire Protocol\n).\nGiven this client-server architecture, a client written in any language can\nbe used to send the appropriate HTTP requests to the server. There are\nalready \nclients written in every popular programming language\n. This also\nmeans that you're free to use whatever test runner and test framework you\nwant; the client libraries are simply HTTP clients and can be mixed into your\ncode any way you please. In other words, Appium \n WebDriver clients are not\ntechnically \"test frameworks\" -- they are \"automation libraries\". You can\nmanage your test environment any way you like!\n\n\nWe meet requirement #3 in the same way: WebDriver has become the de facto\nstandard for automating web browsers, and is a \nW3C Working\nDraft\n.  Why\ndo something totally different for mobile? Instead we have \nextended the\nprotocol\n\nwith extra API methods useful for mobile automation.\n\n\nIt should be obvious that requirement #4 is a given -- you're reading this\nbecause \nAppium is open source\n.\n\n\nAppium Concepts\n\n\nClient/Server Architecture\n\nAppium is at its heart a webserver that exposes a REST API. It receives\nconnections from a client, listens for commands, executes those commands on\na mobile device, and responds with an HTTP response representing the result of\nthe command execution. The fact that we have a client/server architecture opens\nup a lot of possibilities: we can write our test code in any language that has\na http client API, but it is easier to use one of the \nAppium client\nlibraries\n. We can put the server on a different\nmachine than our tests are running on. We can write test code and rely on\na cloud service like \nSauce Labs\n to receive and\ninterpret the commands.\n\n\nSession\n\nAutomation is always performed in the context of a session. Clients initiate\na session with a server in ways specific to each library,\nbut they all end up sending a \nPOST /session\n request to the server,\nwith a JSON object called  the 'desired capabilities' object. At this point\nthe server will start up the automation session and respond with a session ID\nwhich is used for sending further commands.\n\n\nDesired Capabilities\n\nDesired capabilities are a set of keys and values (i.e., a map or hash) sent to\nthe Appium server to tell the server what kind of automation session we're\ninterested in starting up. There are also various capabilities which can modify\nthe behavior of the server during automation.  For example, we might set the\n\nplatformName\n capability to \niOS\n to tell Appium that we want an iOS session,\nrather than an Android or Windows one. Or we might set the \nsafariAllowPopups\n\ncapability to \ntrue\n in order to ensure that, during a Safari automation\nsession, we're allowed to use JavaScript to open up new windows. See the\n\ncapabilities doc\n for the complete\nlist of capabilities available for Appium.\n\n\nAppium Server\n\nAppium is a server written in Node.js. It can be built and installed \nfrom\nsource\n\nor installed directly from \nNPM\n:\n\n\n$ npm install -g appium\n$ appium\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeta\n of Appium is available via NPM with \nnpm install -g appium@beta\n.\nIt is the development version so it might have breaking changes.\nPlease uninstall \nappium@beta\n (\nnpm uninstall -g appium@beta\n) before installing\nnew versions in order to have a clean set of dependencies.\n\n\nAppium Clients\n\nThere are client libraries (in Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript, and C#)\nwhich support Appium's extensions to the WebDriver protocol. When using Appium,\nyou want to use these client libraries instead of your regular WebDriver\nclient. You can view the full list of libraries\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nAppium Desktop\n\nThere is a GUI wrapper around the Appium server that can be downloaded for any\nplatform.  It comes bundled with everything required to run the Appium server,\nso you don't need to worry about Node. It also comes with an Inspector, which\nenables you to check out the hierarchy of your app. This can come in handy when\nwriting tests.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nCongratulations! You are now armed with enough knowledge to begin using Appium.\nWhy not head to the \ngetting started\ndoc\n for more detailed requirements\nand instructions?",

            "text": "Getting Started\n\n\nThis doc will get you up and running with a simple Appium test and introduce\nyou to some basic Appium ideas. For a more comprehensive introduction to Appium concepts,\nplease check out the \nconceptual introduction\n.\n\n\nInstalling Appium\n\n\nAppium can be installed in one of two ways: via \nNPM\n or by\ndownloading \nAppium Desktop\n, which\nis a graphical, desktop-based way to launch the Appium server.\n\n\nInstallation via NPM\n\n\nIf you want to run Appium via an \nnpm install\n, hack with Appium, or contribute\nto Appium, you will need \nNode.js and NPM\n (use\n\nnvm\n,\n\nn\n, or \nbrew install node\n to install\nNode.js. Make sure you have not installed Node or Appium with \nsudo\n, otherwise\nyou'll run into problems). We recommend the latest stable version, though\nAppium supports Node 8+.\n\n\nThe actual installation is as simple as:\n\n\nnpm install -g appium\n\n\n\n\nInstallation via Desktop App Download\n\n\nSimply download the latest version of Appium Desktop from the \nreleases\npage\n.\n\n\nDriver-Specific Setup\n\n\nYou probably want to use Appium to automate something specific, like an iOS or\nAndroid application. Support for the automation of a particular platform is\nprovided by an Appium \"driver\". There are a number of such drivers that give\nyou access to different kinds of automation technologies, and each come with\ntheir own particular setup requirements. Most of these requirements are the\nsame requirements as for app development on a specific platform. For example,\nto automate Android applications using one of our Android drivers, you'll need\nthe Android SDK configured on your system.\n\n\nAt some point, make sure you review the driver documentation for the platform\nyou want to automate, so your system is set up correctly:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nXCUITest Driver\n (for iOS and tvOS apps)\n\n\nThe \nUiAutomator2 Driver\n (for Android apps)\n\n\nThe \nWindows Driver\n (for Windows Desktop apps)\n\n\nThe \nMac Driver\n (for Mac Desktop apps)\n\n\n(BETA) The \nEspresso Driver\n (for Android apps)\n\n\n\n\nVerifying the Installation\n\n\nTo verify that all of Appium's dependencies are met you can use\n\nappium-doctor\n. Install it with \nnpm install -g appium-doctor\n, then run the\n\nappium-doctor\n command, supplying the \n--ios\n or \n--android\n flags to verify\nthat all of the dependencies are set up correctly.\n\n\nAppium Clients\n\n\nWhen all is said and done, Appium is just an HTTP server. It sits and waits for\nconnections from a client, which then instructs Appium what kind of session to\nstart and what kind of automation behaviors to enact once a session is started.\nThis means that you never use Appium just by itself. You always have to use it\nwith a client library of some kind (or, if you're adventurous, cURL!).\n\n\nLuckily, Appium speaks the same protocol as\n\nSelenium\n, called the WebDriver Protocol. You can\ndo a lot of things with Appium just by using one of the standard Selenium\nclients. You may even have one of these on your system already. It's enough to\nget started, especially if you're using Appium for the purpose of testing web\nbrowsers on mobile platforms.\n\n\nAppium can do things that Selenium can't, though, just like mobile devices can\ndo things that web browsers can't. For that reason, we have a set of Appium\nclients in a variety of programming languages, that extend the regular old\nSelenium clients with additional functionality. You can see the list of clients\nand links to download instructions at the \nAppium clients\nlist\n.\n\n\nBefore moving forward, make sure you have a client downloaded in your favorite\nlanguage and ready to go.\n\n\nStarting Appium\n\n\nNow we can kick up an Appium server, either by running it from the command line\nlike so (assuming the NPM install was successful):\n\n\nappium\n\n\n\n\nOr by clicking the huge Start Server button inside of Appium Desktop.\n\n\nAppium will now show you a little welcome message showing the version of Appium\nyou're running and what port it's listening on (the default is \n4723\n). This\nport information is vital since you will have to direct your test client to\nmake sure to connect to Appium on this port. If you want to change, the port,\nyou can do so by using the \n-p\n flag when starting Appium (be sure to check out\nthe full list of \nserver\nparameters\n).\n\n\nRunning Your First Test\n\n\nIn this section we'll run a basic \"Hello World\" Android test. We've chosen\nAndroid because it's available on all platforms. We'll be using the\n\nUiAutomator2 Driver\n so ensure\nyou've read through that doc and gotten your system set up appropriately. We'll\nalso be using JavaScript as the language so that we don't have to deal with\nadditional dependencies.\n\n\n(Chances are, you'll eventually want to automate something other than Android\nusing something other than JavaScript. In that case, check out our\n\nsample-code\n, which has code\nsamples for many languages and platforms.)\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\n\n\n\nWe'll assume you have an Android 8.0 emulator configured and running (the\n  example will work on lower versions, just fix the version numbers\n  accordingly)\n\n\nWe'll assume you have \nthis test\n  APK\n\n  downloaded and available on your local filesystem\n\n\n\n\nSetting up the Appium Client\n\n\nFor this example, we'll use \nWebdriver.io\n as our Appium\nclient. Create a directory for this example, then run:\n\n\nnpm init -y\n\n\n\n\nOnce the project has been initialized, install \nwebdriverio\n:\n\n\nnpm install webdriverio\n\n\n\n\nSession Initialization\n\n\nNow we can create our test file, named \nindex.js\n, and initialize the\nclient object:\n\n\n// javascript\nconst wdio = require(\nwebdriverio\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe next thing we need to do is to start an Appium session. We do this by\ndefining a set of server options and Desired Capabilities, and calling\n\nwdio.remote()\n with them. Desired Capabilities are just a set of keys and\nvalues that get sent to the Appium server during session initialization, that\ntell Appium what kind of thing we want to automate. The minimum set of required\ncapabilities for any Appium driver should include:\n\n\n\n\nplatformName\n: the name of the platform to automate\n\n\nplatformVersion\n: the version of the platform to automate\n\n\ndeviceName\n: the kind of device to automate\n\n\napp\n: the path to the app you want to automate (but use the \nbrowserName\n\n  capability instead in the case of automating a web browser)\n\n\nautomationName\n: the name of the driver you wish to use\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on Desired Capabilities and for a list of all the\nCapabilities you can use in Appium, see our \nCapabilities\ndoc\n.\n\n\nSo here is how we begin to construct a session in our test file:\n\n\n// javascript\nconst opts = {\n  port: 4723,\n  capabilities: {\n    platformName: \nAndroid\n,\n    platformVersion: \n8\n,\n    deviceName: \nAndroid Emulator\n,\n    app: \n/path/to/the/downloaded/ApiDemos.apk\n,\n    appPackage: \nio.appium.android.apis\n,\n    appActivity: \n.view.TextFields\n,\n    automationName: \nUiAutomator2\n\n  }\n};\n\nasync function main () {\n  const client = await wdio.remote(opts);\n\n  await client.deleteSession();\n}\n\nmain();\n\n\n\n\nRunning Test Commands\n\n\nYou can see that we've specified our Appium port and also constructed our\nDesired Capabilities to match our requirements (but don't forget to replace the\npath with the actual download path for your system). We've registered this fact\nwith \nwebdriverio\n and now have a client object which will represent the\nconnection to the Appium server. From here, we can go ahead and start the\nsession, perform some test commands, and end the session. In our case, we will\nsimply tap into a few menus and then back out the way we came before ending the\nsession:\n\n\n// javascript\n\nconst field = await client.$(\nandroid.widget.EditText\n);\nawait field.setValue(\nHello World!\n);\nconst value = await field.getText();\nassert.equal(value, \nHello World!\n);\n\n\n\n\nWhat's going on here is that after creating a session and launching our app,\nwe're instructing Appium to find an element in the app hierarchy and click on\nit. Specifically, \nwebdriverio\n has a convention where the \n~\n prefix means to\nfind an element by its \"accessbility id\", which in the case of Android means an\nelement's \"content description\". So we find and tap on these elements in order\nto navigate through the app's menu system. Then we can use the \nback()\n method\nto trigger the Android \"back\" behavior and get back to where we started before\nending the session.\n\n\nPutting it all together, the file should look like:\n\n\n// javascript\n\nconst wdio = require(\nwebdriverio\n);\nconst assert = require(\nassert\n);\n\nconst opts = {\n  port: 4723,\n  capabilities: {\n    platformName: \nAndroid\n,\n    platformVersion: \n8\n,\n    deviceName: \nAndroid Emulator\n,\n    app: \n/path/to/the/downloaded/ApiDemos.apk\n,\n    appPackage: \nio.appium.android.apis\n,\n    appActivity: \n.view.TextFields\n,\n    automationName: \nUiAutomator2\n\n  }\n};\n\nasync function main () {\n  const client = await wdio.remote(opts);\n\n  const field = await client.$(\nandroid.widget.EditText\n);\n  await field.setValue(\nHello World!\n);\n  const value = await field.getText();\n  assert.equal(value,\nHello World!\n);\n\n  await client.deleteSession();\n}\n\nmain();\n\n\n\n\nYou can try and run this test on your own. Simply save it and execute it using\n\nnode\n:\n\n\nnode index.js\n\n\n\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, you'll see Appium begin spitting out\nlots of logs and eventually the app will pop up on the screen and start\nbehaving as if an invisible user were tapping on it!\n\n\nWhat's Next\n\n\nWe've only scratched the surface of what you can do with Appium. Check out\nthese resources to help you on your journey:\n\n\n\n\nThe Appium \ncommand reference\n - learn about what commands are available, how to use them with specific client libraries, etc...\n\n\n\n\nThe \nsample-code\n directory, where lots more code samples are available\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndiscuss.appium.io\n - this is the Appium community forum, which is a great first place to go for help getting started, or if you think you may have run into a bug\n\n\n\n\nThe Appium \nissue tracker\n - let the Appium maintainers know here if you think you've found a bug",

Read our \nintroduction to Appium drivers\n)\n. This driver\nleverages Apple's\n\nXCUITest\n\nlibraries under the hood in order to facilitate automation of your app . This\naccess to XCUITest is mediated by the\n\nWebDriverAgent\n server.\nWebDriverAgent (also referred to as \"WDA\") is a project managed by Facebook, to\nwhich the Appium core team contributes heavily. WDA is a WebDriver-compatible\nserver that runs in the context of an iOS simulator or device and exposes the\nXCUITest API. Appium's XCUITest driver manages WDA as a subprocess opaque to\nthe Appium user, proxies commands to/from WDA, and provides a host of\nadditional functionality (like simulator management and other methods, for\nexample).\n\n\nDevelopment of the XCUITest driver happens at the\n\nappium-xcuitest-driver\n\nrepo.\n\n\nRequirements and Support\n\n\nIn addition to Appium's general requirements:\n\n\n\n\nApple's XCUITest library is only available on iOS simulators and devices that\n  are running iOS 9.3 or higher.\n\n\nA Mac computer with macOS 10.11 or 10.12 is required.\n\n\nXcode 7 or higher is required.\n\n\nThe XCUITest driver was available in Appium starting with Appium 1.6.\n\n\nFor correct functioning of the driver, additional system libraries are\n  required (see the Setup sections below).\n\n\n\n\nMigrating from the UIAutomation Driver\n\n\nIf you are migrating to the XCUITest driver from Appium's old\n\nUIAutomation-based driver\n, you may wish\nto consult this \nmigration\nguide\n.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThe way to start a session using the XCUITest driver is to include the\n\nautomationName\n \ncapability\n in your \nnew session request\n, with\nthe value \nXCUITest\n. Of course, you must also include appropriate\n\nplatformName\n, \nplatformVersion\n, \ndeviceName\n, and \napp\n capabilities, at\na minimum.\n\n\nThe \nplatformName\n should be \niOS\n for iPhone or iPad. tvOS devices are available if the \nplatformName\n is \ntvOS\n.\n\n\n\n\niOS\n   \njson\n   {\n      \"automationName\": \"XCUITest\",\n      \"platformName\": \"iOS\",\n      \"platformVersion\": \"12.2\",\n      \"deviceName\": \"iPhone 8\",\n      ...\n   }\n\n\ntvOS\n   \njson\n   {\n      \"automationName\": \"XCUITest\",\n      \"platformName\": \"tvOS\",\n      \"platformVersion\": \"12.2\",\n      \"deviceName\": \"Apple TV\",\n      ...\n   }\n\n\n\n\nCapabilities\n\n\nThe XCUITest driver supports a number of standard \nAppium\ncapabilities\n, but has an additional\nset of capabilities that modulate the behavior of the driver. These can be\nfound currently at the \nappium-xcuitest-driver\nREADME\n.\n\n\nTo automate Safari instead of your own application, leave the \napp\n capability\nempty and instead set the \nbrowserName\n capability to \nSafari\n.\n\n\nCommands\n\n\nTo see the various commands Appium supports, and specifically for information\non how the commands map to behaviors for the XCUITest driver, see the \nAPI\nReference\n.\n\n\nBasic Setup\n\n\n(We recommend the use of \nHomebrew\n for installing system\ndependencies)\n\n\n\n\nEnsure that you have Appium's general dependencies (e.g., Node\n   \n NPM) installed and configured.\n\n\n\n\nInstall the \nCarthage\n dependency\n   manager:\n\n\nbash\nbrew install carthage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't need to automate real devices, you're done! To automate an app on\nthe simulator, the \napp\n capability should be set to an absolute path or url\npointing to your \n.app\n or \n.app.zip\n file, built for the sim.\n\n\nReal Device Setup\n\n\nAutomating a real device with XCUITest is considerably more complicated, due to\nApple's restrictions around running apps on real devices. Please refer to the\n\nXCUITest real device setup doc\n for\ninstructions.\n\n\nOnce set up, running a session on a real device is achieved by using the\nfollowing desired capabilities:\n\n\n\n\napp\n or \nbundleId\n - specifies the application (local path or url referencing\n   your signed \n.ipa\n file) , or, if it is already installed, simply the bundle\n   identifier of the app so that Appium can launch it.\n\n\nudid\n - the specific id of the device to test on. This can also be set to\n   \nauto\n if there is only a single device, in which case Appium will determine\n   the device id and use it.\n\n\n\n\nOptional Setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall idb for better handling of various iOS Simulator operations,\nsuch as: biometrics, geolocation setting and window focussing.\n\n\n\n\nRead https://github.com/appium/appium-idb#installation to install necessary libraries (since Appium 1.14.0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nAppleSimulatorUtils\n\nto use the \npermissions capability\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiles generated by test runs\n\n\nTesting on iOS generates files that can sometimes get large. These include\nlogs, temporary files, and derived data from Xcode runs. Generally the\nfollowing locations are where they are found, should they need to be deleted:\n\n\n$HOME/Library/Logs/CoreSimulator/*\n$HOME/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*\n\n\n\n\nConfigure keyboards\n\n\nOver Appium 1.14.0, Appium configures keyboard preferences by default to make test running more stable. You can change sone of them via settings API.\n\n\n\n\nTurn \nAuto-Correction\n in \nKeyboards\n off\n\n\nTurn \nPredictive\n in \nKeyboards\n off\n\n\nMark keyboard tutorial as complete\n\n\n(Only for Simulator) Toggle software keyboard on",

While this is simple in theory, the hoops\nof code signing and provisioning applications for development and testing can\nmake this a bit of a headache.\n\n\nThe documentation on \nappium-xcuitest-driver\n is also helpful to resolve dependencies.\n\n\nBasic (automatic) configuration\n\n\nThe easiest way to get up-and-running with Appium's XCUITest support on iOS\nreal devices is to use the automatic configuration strategy. There are two ways\nto do this:\n\n\n\n\nUse the \nxcodeOrgId\n and \nxcodeSigningId\n desired capabilities:\n\n\n\n\n    {\n      \nxcodeOrgId\n: \nTeam ID\n,\n      \nxcodeSigningId\n: \niPhone Developer\n\n    }\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a \n.xcconfig\n file somewhere on your file system and add the following to it:\n\n\n\n\n    DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = \nTeam ID\n\n    CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = iPhone Developer\n\n\n\n\nIn either case, the Team ID is a unique 10-character string generated by Apple\nthat is assigned to your team. You can find your Team ID using your developer\naccount. Sign in to \ndeveloper.apple.com/account\n,\nand click Membership in the sidebar. Your Team ID appears in the Membership\nInformation section under the team name. You can also find your team ID listed\nunder the \"Organizational Unit\" field in your iPhone Developer certificate in\nyour keychain.\n\n\nNote that these are mutually exclusive strategies; use \neither\n the\n\nxcodeConfigFile\n capability or the combination of \nxcodeOrgId\n and \nxcodeSigningId\n.\n\n\nOnce this configuration is done, it should just be a matter of starting your test\nspecifying a real device in your \nudid\n desired capability.\n\n\nIf this has not worked it will usually manifest itself in the Appium server logs\nas some error followed by \ninfo XCUITest xcodebuild exited with code '65' and\nsignal 'null'\n. This usually means that the necessary code signing is not set up\ncorrectly. Go on to the \nBasic (manual) configuration\n\nto fix.\n\n\nIf the \nWebDriverAgentRunner\n is successfully installed on the device, but in the\nAppium logs there is an error message something like:\n\n\n2017-01-24 09:02:18.358 xcodebuild[30385:339674] Error Domain=com.apple.platform.iphoneos Code=-12 \nUnable to launch com.apple.test.WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner\n UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Unable to launch com.apple.test.WebDriverAgentRunner-Runner, NSUnderlyingError=0x7fa839cadc60 {Error Domain=DTXMessage Code=1 \n(null)\n UserInfo={DTXExceptionKey=The operation couldn\u2019t be completed.

If you manually\ntry to run the \nWebDriverAgentRunner\n app on the device, you will see a popup\nmessage:\n\n\n\n\nYou can go to Settings =\n General =\n Device Management on the device to trust\nthe developer and allow the \nWebDriverAgentRunner\n app to be run (see \nApple\ndocumentation for more information\n).\n\n\nBasic (manual) configuration\n\n\nThere are many cases in which the basic automatic configuration is not enough. This\nusually has to do with code signing and the configuration of the project to be\nable to be run on the real device under test. Often this happens when the\ndevelopment account being used is a \"Free\" one, in which case it is not possible\nto create a wildcard provisioning profile, and will often not create one for the\ndefault application bundle.\n\n\nThis will manifest as something like an error that Xcode \nfailed to create\nprovisioning profile\n:\n\n\n\n\nThe easiest way around this is to create a provisioning profile by opening\n\nXcode\n and creating a new project:\n\n\n\n\nThe type does not matter, other than it being \"iOS\". \"Single View Application\"\nis the easiest:\n\n\n\n\nThe important part is to use a unique \"Product Name\" and \"Organization Name\". Also,\nat this point, specify your \"Team\".\n\n\n\n\nYou can confirm that the provisioning profile was created by looking at the \"Project\"\ntab:\n\n\n\n\nOr by going into your account preferences and seeing the provisioning profile:\n\n\n\n\nAt this point you have a valid provisioning profile. Make note of the bundle id\nyou associated with it, and add that in the \nupdatedWDABundleId\n desired\ncapability for your tests. Then follow the \ninitial instructions for automatic\nconfiguration\n.\n\n\nFull manual configuration\n\n\nAlternatively, the provisioning profile can be manually associated with the\nproject (keep in mind that this will have to be done each time the\nWebDriverAgent is updated, which includes every time a new version of Appium is\ninstalled, and is \nnot\n recommended):\n\n\n\n\nFind out where your Appium installation is:\n\n\n\n\n    $ which appium\n    /path/where/installed/bin/appium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven this installation location, \n/path/where/installed/bin/appium\n, \nWebDriverAgent\n\n    will be found in \n/path/where/installed/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent\n.\n    Open a terminal and go to that location, then run the following in order to\n    set the project up:\n\n\n\n\n    mkdir -p Resources/WebDriverAgent.bundle\n    ./Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen \nWebDriverAgent.xcodeproj\n in Xcode. For \nboth\n the \nWebDriverAgentLib\n\n    and \nWebDriverAgentRunner\n targets, select \"Automatically manage signing\"\n    in the \"General\" tab, and then select your \nDevelopment Team\n. This\n    should also auto select \nSigning Ceritificate\n. The outcome should look as\n    shown below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXcode may fail to create a provisioning profile for the \nWebDriverAgentRunner\n\n  target:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis necessitates manually changing the bundle id for the target by going\n  into the \"Build Settings\" tab, and changing the \"Product Bundle Identifier\"\n  from \ncom.facebook.WebDriverAgentRunner\n to something that Xcode will accept:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing back to the \"General\" tab for the \nWebDriverAgentRunner\n target, you\n  should now see that it has created a provisioning profile and all is well:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, you can verify that everything works. Build the project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    xcodebuild -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner -destination 'id=\nudid\n' test\n\n\n\n\nIf this was successful, the output should end with something like:\n\n\n    Test Suite 'All tests' started at 2017-01-23 15:49:12.585\n    Test Suite 'WebDriverAgentRunner.xctest' started at 2017-01-23 15:49:12.586\n    Test Suite 'UITestingUITests' started at 2017-01-23 15:49:12.587\n    Test Case '-[UITestingUITests testRunner]' started.\n        t =     0.00s     Start Test at 2017-01-23 15:49:12.588\n        t =     0.00s     Set Up\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo completely verify, you can try accessing the WebDriverAgent server status\n    (\nnote:\n you \nmust\n be on the same network as the device, and know its IP\n    address, from Settings =\n Wi-Fi =\n Current Network):\n\n\n\n\n    export DEVICE_URL='http://\ndevice IP\n:8100'\n    export JSON_HEADER='-H \nContent-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8, accept: application/json\n'\n    curl -X GET $JSON_HEADER $DEVICE_URL/status\n\n\n\n\nYou ought to get back output something like this:\n\n\n\n    {\n      \nvalue\n : {\n        \nstate\n : \nsuccess\n,\n        \nos\n : {\n          \nname\n : \niOS\n,\n          \nversion\n : \n10.2\n\n        },\n        \nios\n : {\n          \nsimulatorVersion\n : \n10.2\n,\n          \nip\n : \n192.168.0.7\n\n        },\n        \nbuild\n : {\n          \ntime\n : \nJan 23 2017 14:59:57\n\n        }\n      },\n      \nsessionId\n : \n8951A6DD-F3AD-410E-A5DB-D042F42F68A7\n,\n      \nstatus\n : 0\n    }\n\n\n\n\nConfiguring the app under test\n\n\nNot only does WebDriverAgent need to be configured to run on your device, but\nyour app must also be able to run on your device. The central requirements are\nthe same: to have a build of your app (an \n.ipa\n file) signed with\na development provisioning profile. A good overview of the process can be found\n\nhere\n\nand\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nIn a little more detail, to get started on a real device, you will need the following:\n\n\n\n\nAn \nApple Developer ID\n and a valid\nDeveloper Account with a configured development certificate and provisioning\nprofile.\n\n\nA valid iOS Development Certificate and Provisioning Profile are necessary to\ntest on a real device. Your app will also need to be signed. You can find\ninformation about this in the \nApple documentation\n.\n\n\nAn iPad or iPhone. Make sure this has been set up for development in Xcode.\n\n\nA signed \n.app\n or \n.ipa\n file of your app, or the source code to build one.\n\n\nA Mac with \nXcode\n and the Xcode Command\nLine Developer Tools.\n\n\n\n\nAppium handles installing the application to the device, using\n\nideviceinstaller\n (which is installed as part of \nlibimobiledevice\n), but it\nis sometimes easier to pre-install your app using Xcode to ensure there are no\nproblems (see again the \nApple\ndocumentation\n\nfor this).\n\n\nTroubleshooting ideas\n\n\n\n\nMake sure UDID is correct by checking it in Xcode Organizer or iTunes. It\n   is a long string (20+ chars).\n\n\nMake sure that you can run your tests against the Simulator.\n\n\nMake sure UI Automation is enabled on your device.

Build the project:        xcodebuild -project WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj -scheme WebDriverAgentRunner -destination 'id= udid ' test  If this was successful, the output should end with something like:      Test Suite 'All tests' started at 2017-01-23 15:49:12.585\n    Test Suite 'WebDriverAgentRunner.xctest' started at 2017-01-23 15:49:12.586\n    Test Suite 'UITestingUITests' started at 2017-01-23 15:49:12.587\n    Test Case '-[UITestingUITests testRunner]' started.\n        t =     0.00s     Start Test at 2017-01-23 15:49:12.588\n        t =     0.00s     Set Up   To completely verify, you can try accessing the WebDriverAgent server status\n    ( note:  you  must  be on the same network as the device, and know its IP\n    address, from Settings =  Wi-Fi =  Current Network):       export DEVICE_URL='http:// device IP :8100'\n    export JSON_HEADER='-H  Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8, accept: application/json '\n    curl -X GET $JSON_HEADER $DEVICE_URL/status  You ought to get back output something like this:      {\n       value  : {\n         state  :  success ,\n         os  : {\n           name  :  iOS ,\n           version  :  10.2 \n        },\n         ios  : {\n           simulatorVersion  :  10.2 ,\n           ip  :  192.168.0.7 \n        },\n         build  : {\n           time  :  Jan 23 2017 14:59:57 \n        }\n      },\n       sessionId  :  8951A6DD-F3AD-410E-A5DB-D042F42F68A7 ,\n       status  : 0\n    }",

The information in this doc may not keep up to date\nwith reality, and the driver will be removed in a future version of Appium.\nTo begin iOS automation with Appium today, please use the \nXCUITest\nDriver\n instead.\n\n\n\n\nAppium's former method for iOS app automation was based on \nUIAutomation\n, an\nApple-provided framework that shipped with the iOS SDK until iOS 10, when it\nwas removed. \nUIAutomation\n was one of the tools included in Apple's\nInstruments profiling system, and provided a JavaScript API that ran\nsynchronously in the context of a single app. The Appium UIAutomation driver\nestablished an asynchronous, session-based WebDriver front end for this API.\n\n\nDevelopment of the UIAutomation driver is done at the\n\nappium-ios-driver\n repo.\n\n\nRequirements and Support\n\n\nIn addition to Appium's general requirements:\n\n\n\n\nXcode 7 or lower.\n\n\niOS simulators or devices with version 9.3 or lower.\n\n\nAll versions of Appium ship with this driver.\n\n\nFor correct functioning of the driver, see additional setup below.\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nThe way to start a session using the UIAutomation driver is to set the\n\nplatformName\n \ncapability\n in your \nnew session request\n to the\nvalue of \niOS\n. Of course, you must also include appropriate \nplatformVersion\n,\n\ndeviceName\n, and \napp\n capabilities, at a minimum.\n\n\nCapabilities\n\n\nThe UIAutomation driver supports a number of standard \nAppium\ncapabilities\n, but has an additional\nset of capabilities that work for this driver only (see the \niOS\nsection\n of the\naforementioned doc).\n\n\nTo automate Safari instead of your own application, leave the \napp\n capability\nempty and instead set the \nbrowserName\n capability to \nSafari\n.\n\n\nCommands\n\n\nTo see the various commands Appium supports, and specifically for information\non how the commands map to behaviors for the UIAutomation driver, see the \nAPI\nReference\n.\n\n\nSimulator Setup\n\n\n(Note that due to limitations of Xcode and the iOS simulator, only one\nsimulator may be open, and automated, at any given time. For multiple simulator\nsupport, you will need to upgrade to the \nXCUITest driver\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo allow the iOS simulator to be automated by Instruments, you need to\n   modify the authorization database for the system. Appium provides an easy\n   way to do this by installing and running an authorization script:\n\n\nsudo authorize-ios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, Instruments-based automation is limited by the inclusion of\n   a 1-second hard-coded delay between commands, implemented for obscure\n   reasons by Apple's engineers. There is a way around this limitation called\n   \ninstruments-without-delay\n\n   (IWD). IWD ships with Appium for Xcode versions \n 7. For 7.x and up, IWD\n   must be installed manually by the user in advance of using Appium. The way\n   to do this is as follows:\n\n\n\n\nClone the \nappium-ios-driver\n\n  repository.\n\n\n\n\nInside the repo, run the \nxcode-iwd.sh\n script included in the \nbin\n dir,\n  passing it several arguments: (1) the path to the Xcode app you are\n  using. (2) The path to the appium-instruments directory. For example:\n\n\nsh ./bin/xcode-iwd.sh /Applications/Xcode.app /Users/me/appium-instruments/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor best results, launch each simulator you wish to use and ensure the following:\n\n\n\n\nThe soft keyboard is enabled (Command+K in the Simulator app)\n\n\nUIAutomation is enabled in the Developer settings menu\n\n\nThere is not more than one simulator with the same name in Xcode's\n  \"Devices\" organizer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Device Setup\n\n\nRunning tests on real devices is considerably more complicated due to code\nsigning and additional workarounds to Apple limitations. The basic process for\na successful automation strategy using this driver are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild your app with a Debug configuration, for the specific type of real\n   device you will run the test on, ensuring that the app is also signed for\n   running on your specific device. For example:\n\n\nxcodebuild -sdk \niphoneos\n -target \ntarget_name\n -configuration Debug \\\n    CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=\"iPhone Developer: Mister Smith\" \\\n    PROVISIONING_PROFILE=\"XXXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXX\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall the built app (usually now located in a build directory specified in\n   Xcode) to your test device yourself, ensuring it exists on the device and\n   there are no signing issues. There are a number of methods for installing\n   apps onto devices. One is to just use Xcode itself. Another is to use the\n   \nideviceinstaller\n tool provided as part of the \nlibimobiledevice\n suite.\n   A third is to use \nios-deploy\n.\n   Here's an example for \nideviceinstaller\n:\n\n\n```\n\n\nfirst install ideviceinstaller, using Homebrew (http://brew.sh)\n\n\nbrew install libimobiledevice\nideviceinstaller -u \n -i \n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the bundle ID of your application as the value of the \napp\n capability.\n\n\n\n\nUse the UDID of your device as the \nudid\n capability.\n\n\nAs above, ensure that UI Automation is enabled in the Developer settings.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing these steps should ensure your success! If you're using newer\nversions of Xcode (7.x, for example), you may wish to consult the \nXCUITest\nDriver Real Device Docs\n as they\nmay contain some pertinent information as well.\n\n\nReal Device Hybrid / Web Testing\n\n\nFor hybrid and web testing, Appium requires the use of the Remote Debugging\nProtocol to send JavaScript to execute inside a web view. For real iOS devices,\nthis protocol is encrypted and access must be facilitated using a 3rd-party\ntool, provided by Google, called\n\nios-webkit-debug-proxy\n\n(IWDP). For information on installing and using IWDP within Appium, check out\nthe \nIWDP doc\n.\n\n\nFor web testing, i.e., tests that run in the Safari browser, we have another\nhurdle to jump. On real devices, apps that are not signed by the developer\ncannot be instrumented with UIAutomation. Safari is one such app. Thus we have\na helper app called \nSafariLauncher\n, which \ncan\n be signed by the developer.\nIts sole purpose upon launching is to turn around and launch Safari, which can\nthen be automated via the Remote Debugger in conjunction with IWDP. Unfortunately\nyou cannot, in this case, move into the native context and do any automation of\nthe browser itself.\n\n\nFor instructions on setting up \nSafariLauncher\n, check out the \nSafariLauncher\ndoc\n.\n\n\nFiles generated by iOS test runs\n\n\nTesting on iOS generates files that can sometimes get large. These include\nlogs, temporary files, and derived data from Xcode runs. Generally the\nfollowing locations are where they are found, should they need to be deleted:\n\n\n$HOME/Library/Logs/CoreSimulator/*\n/Library/Caches/com.apple.dt.instruments/*\n\n\n\n\nRunning iOS tests using Jenkins\n\n\nFirst download the \njenkins-cli.jar\n and verify that the Mac successfully\nconnects to Jenkins master. Ensure you've run the \nauthorize-ios\n command\nmentioned above.\n\n\nwget https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar\n\njava -jar jenkins-cli.jar \\\n -s https://team-appium.ci.cloudbees.com \\\n -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \\\n on-premise-executor \\\n -fsroot ~/jenkins \\\n -labels osx \\\n -name mac_appium\n\n\n\n\nNext define a LaunchAgent for Jenkins to launch automatically on login.\nA LaunchDaemon will not work because daemons don't have GUI access. Make sure\nthe plist doesn't contain the \nSessionCreate\n or \nUser\n key as that may prevent\ntests from running.

Open the sample folder as an existing project in a Java IDE such as\n   IntelliJ. For example:\n   \nCalculatorTest\n\n2. In the Java IDE build and run the test\n\n\nC# Samples\n\n1.

The input source has a unique ID.\n\n\naction: An action that is dispatched to an input source. For a keyboard source, this can be 'keyDown' or 'keyUp'. For a pointer event this can be 'pointerMove',\n  'pointerDown', or 'pointerUp'. 'pause' events can also be sent to the device.\n\n\n\n\nThe Actions API takes a list of input sources and executes each 'tick'. A 'tick' is a slice of an action chain, so if you have two input sources, the first 'tick'\nis the 0-indexed action, the second 'tick' is the 1-indexed action, etc....

Appium will\nunpack it for you. Nice if you're not using Appium locally.\n\n\nPreparing your app for test (Android)\n\n\nNothing in particular needs to be done to run your .apk using Appium. If you\nwant to zip it up, you can.\n\n\nPreparing your app for test (Windows)\n\n\nNothing in particular needs to be done to run your test.\n\n\nRunning your test app with Appium (iOS)\n\n\nThe best way to see what to do currently is to look at the example tests:\n\n\nNode.js\n | \nPython\n | \nPHP\n | \nRuby\n | \nJava\n\n\nBasically, first make sure Appium is running:\n\n\nnode .\n\n\n\nThen script your WebDriver test, sending in the following desired capabilities:\n\n\n// javascript\n{\n    platformName: 'iOS',\n    platformVersion: '7.1',\n    deviceName: 'iPhone Simulator',\n    app: myApp\n}\n\n\n\n\n# python\n{\n    'platformName': 'iOS',\n    'platformVersion': '7.1',\n    'deviceName': 'iPhone Simulator',\n    'app': myApp\n}\n\n\n\n\n// php\npublic static $browsers = array(\n    array(\n        'desiredCapabilities' =\n array(\n            'platformName' =\n 'iOS',\n            'platformVersion' =\n '7.1',\n            'deviceName' =\n 'iPhone Simulator',\n            'app' =\n $myApp\n        )\n    )\n);\n\n\n\n\n// java\nDesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, \niOS\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_VERSION, \n7.1\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.DEVICE_NAME, \niPhone Simulator\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.APP, myApp);\n\n\n\n\nIn this set of capabilities, \nmyApp\n must be either:\n\n\n\n\nA local absolute path to your simulator-compiled .app directory or .zip\n\n\nA url of a zip file containing your .app package\n\n\nA path to one of the sample app relative to the appium install root\n\n\n\n\nUsing your WebDriver library of choice, set the remote session to use these\ncapabilities and connect to the server running at port 4723 of localhost (or\nwhatever host and port you specified when you started Appium). You should be\nall set now!\n\n\nRunning your test app with Appium (Android)\n\n\nFirst, make sure you have one and only one Android emulator or device\nconnected. If you run \nadb devices\n, for example, you should see one device\nconnected. This is the device Appium will use for tests. Of course, to have\na device connected, you'll need to have made an Android AVD. If the Android SDK\ntools are on your path, you can simply run:\n\n\nemulator -avd \nMyAvdName\n\n\n\n\nAnd wait for the android emulator to finish launching.

You may specify\nmultiple wait activities for instance:\n\n\n\n\nappActivity: 'com.splash.SplashScreen'\n\n\nappPackage: 'com.splash' appActivity: '.SplashScreen'\n\n\nappPackage: 'com.splash' appActivity: '.SplashScreen,.LandingPage,com.why.GoThere'\n\n\n\n\nIf you are not sure what activity are configured in your apk, you can\nproceed in one of the following ways:\n\n\n\n\nMac/Linux: 'adb shell dumpsys window windows | grep mFocusedApp'\n\n\nIn the Ruby console: 'adb shell dumpsys window windows`.each_line.grep(/mFocusedApp/).first.strip'\n\n\nIn Windows terminal run 'adb shell dumpsys window windows' and manually look for the mFocusedApp line.\n\n\n\n\nThen script your WebDriver test, sending in the following desired capabilities:\n\n\n// javascript\n{\n    platformName: 'Android',\n    platformVersion: '4.4',\n    deviceName: 'Android Emulator',\n    app: myApp\n}\n\n\n\n\n# python\n{\n    'platformName': 'Android',\n    'platformVersion': '4.4',\n    'deviceName': 'Android Emulator',\n    'app': myApp\n}\n\n\n\n\n// php\npublic static $browsers = array(\n    array(\n        'desiredCapabilities' =\n array(\n            'platformName' =\n 'Android',\n            'platformVersion' =\n '4.4',\n            'deviceName' =\n 'Android Emulator',\n            'app' =\n $myApp\n        )\n    )\n);\n\n\n\n\n// java\nDesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, \nAndroid\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_VERSION, \n4.4\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.DEVICE_NAME, \nAndroid Emulator\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.APP, myApp);\n\n\n\n\nIn this set of capabilities, \nmyApp\n must be either:\n\n\n\n\nA local absolute path to your .apk or a .zip of it\n\n\nA url of a zip file containing your .apk\n\n\nA path to one of the sample app relative to the appium install root\n\n\n\n\nUsing your WebDriver library of choice, set the remote session to use these\ncapabilities and connect to the server running at port 4723 of localhost (or\nwhatever host and port you specified when you started Appium). You should be\nall set now!\n\n\nRunning your test app with Appium (Android devices \n 4.2, and hybrid tests)\n\n\nAndroid devices before version 4.2 (API Level 17) do not have Google's\n\nUiAutomator framework\n\ninstalled. This is what Appium uses to perform the automation behaviors on\nthe device. For earlier devices or tests of hybrid (webview-based) apps,\nAppium comes bundled with another automation backend called [Selendroid]\n(http://selendroid.io/).\n\n\nTo use Selendroid, all that is required is to slightly change the set of\ndesired capabilities mentioned above, by adding the \nautomationName\n capability\nand specifying the Selendroid automation backend. It is usually the case that you\nalso need to use a \n.\n before your activity name (e.g., \n.MainActivity\n instead\nof \nMainActivity\n for your \nappActivity\n capability).\n\n\n// javascript\n{\n    automationName: 'Selendroid',\n    platformName: 'Android',\n    platformVersion: '2.3',\n    deviceName: 'Android Emulator',\n    app: myApp,\n    appPackage: 'com.mycompany.package',\n    appActivity: '.MainActivity'\n}\n\n\n\n\n# python\n{\n    'automationName': 'Selendroid',\n    'platformName': 'Android',\n    'platformVersion': '2.3',\n    'deviceName': 'Android Emulator',\n    'app': myApp,\n    'appPackage': 'com.mycompany.package',\n    'appActivity': '.MainActivity'\n}\n\n\n\n\n// php\npublic static $browsers = array(\n    array(\n        'desiredCapabilities' =\n array(\n            'automationName' =\n 'Selendroid',\n            'platformName' =\n 'Android',\n            'platformVersion' =\n '2.3',\n            'deviceName' =\n 'Android Emulator',\n            'app' =\n $myApp,\n            'appPackage' =\n 'com.mycompany.package',\n            'appActivity'=\n '.MainActivity'\n        )\n    )\n);\n\n\n\n\n// java\nDesiredCapabilities capabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.AUTOMATION_NAME, \nSelendroid\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_NAME, \nAndroid\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.PLATFORM_VERSION, \n2.3\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.DEVICE_NAME, \nAndroid Emulator\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.APP, myApp);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.APP_PACKAGE: \ncom.mycompany.package\n);\ncapabilities.setCapability(MobileCapabilityType.APP_ACTIVITY: \n.MainActivity\n);\n\n\n\n\nNow Appium will start up a Selendroid test session instead of the default test\nsession. One of the downsides to using Selendroid is that its API differs\nsometimes significantly with Appium's. Therefore we recommend you thoroughly\nread \nSelendroid's documentation\n before\nwriting your scripts for older devices or hybrid apps.\n\n\nRunning your test app with Appium (Windows)\n\n\nSimply ensure that Appium is listening, and run your test with your test runner of choice.\n\n\nSee our \nsamples\n for details.",

By default this capability is received from the package manifest (@package attribute value)  com.example.android.myApp ,  com.android.settings    appWaitActivity  Activity name/names, comma separated, for the Android activity you want to wait for. By default the value of this capability is the same as for  appActivity . You must set it to the very first focused application activity name in case it is different from the one which is set as  appActivity  if your capability has  appActivity  and  appPackage .  SplashActivity ,  SplashActivity,OtherActivity ,  * ,  *.SplashActivity    appWaitPackage  Java package of the Android app you want to wait for.

The default is  8200  in general and selects one port from  8200  to  8299  for  appium-uiautomator2-server , it is  8300  from  8300  to  8399  for  appium-espresso-driver . When you run tests in parallel, you must adjust the port to avoid conflicts. Read  Parallel Testing Setup Guide  for more details.  e.g.,  8201    remoteAdbHost  Optional remote ADB server host  e.g.: 192.168.0.101    androidDeviceSocket  Devtools socket name. Needed only when tested app is a Chromium embedding browser. The socket is open by the browser and Chromedriver connects to it as a devtools client.  e.g.,  chrome_devtools_remote    avd  Name of avd to launch  e.g.,  api19    avdLaunchTimeout  How long to wait in milliseconds for an avd to launch and connect to ADB (default  60000 )  300000    avdReadyTimeout  How long to wait in milliseconds for an avd to finish its boot animations (default  120000 )  300000    avdArgs  Additional emulator arguments used when launching an avd  e.g.,  -netfast    useKeystore  Use a custom keystore to sign apks, default  false  true  or  false    keystorePath  Path to custom keystore, default ~/.android/debug.keystore  e.g.,  /path/to.keystore    keystorePassword  Password for custom keystore  e.g.,  foo    keyAlias  Alias for key  e.g.,  androiddebugkey    keyPassword  Password for key  e.g.,  foo    chromedriverExecutable  The absolute local path to webdriver executable (if Chromium embedder provides its own webdriver, it should be used instead of original chromedriver bundled with Appium)  /abs/path/to/webdriver    chromedriverArgs  An array of arguments to be passed to the chromedriver binary when it's run by Appium. By default no CLI args are added beyond what Appium uses internally (such as  --url-base ,  --port ,  --adb-port , and  --log-path .  e.g.,  [\"--disable-gpu\", \"--disable-web-security\"]    chromedriverExecutableDir  The absolute path to a directory to look for Chromedriver executables in, for automatic discovery of compatible Chromedrivers. Ignored if  chromedriverUseSystemExecutable  is  true  /abs/path/to/chromedriver/directory    chromedriverChromeMappingFile  The absolute path to a file which maps Chromedriver versions to the minimum Chrome that it supports. Ignored if  chromedriverUseSystemExecutable  is  true  /abs/path/to/mapping.json    chromedriverUseSystemExecutable  If  true , bypasses automatic Chromedriver configuration and uses the version that comes downloaded with Appium. Ignored if  chromedriverExecutable  is set. Defaults to  false  e.g.,  true    autoWebviewTimeout  Amount of time to wait for Webview context to become active, in ms. Defaults to  2000  e.g.  4    chromedriverPort  Numeric port to start Chromedriver on. Note that use of this capability is discouraged as it will cause undefined behavior in case there are multiple webviews present. By default Appium will find a free port.  e.g.  8000    chromedriverPorts  A list of valid ports for Appium to use for communication with Chromedrivers. This capability supports multiple webview scenarios. The form of this capability is an array of numeric ports, where array items can themselves be arrays of length 2, where the first element is the start of an inclusive range and the second is the end. By default, Appium will use any free port.  e.g.  [8000, [9000, 9005]]    dontStopAppOnReset  Doesn't stop the process of the app under test, before starting the app using adb. If the app under test is created by another anchor app, setting this false, allows the process of the anchor app to be still alive, during the start of the test app using adb. In other words, with  dontStopAppOnReset  set to  true , we will not include the  -S  flag in the  adb shell am start  call. With this capability omitted or set to  false , we include the  -S  flag. Default  false  true  or  false    unicodeKeyboard  Enable Unicode input, default  false  true  or  false    resetKeyboard  Reset keyboard to its original state, after running Unicode tests with  unicodeKeyboard  capability.

This capability can speed up test execution, since Accessibility commands will run faster ignoring some elements. The ignored elements will not be findable, which is why this capability has also been implemented as a toggle-able  setting  as well as a capability. Defaults to  false  true  or  false    disableAndroidWatchers  Disables android watchers that watch for application not responding and application crash, this will reduce cpu usage on android device/emulator. This capability will work only with UiAutomator and not with selendroid, default  false  true  or  false    chromeOptions  Allows passing chromeOptions capability for ChromeDriver. For more information see  chromeOptions  chromeOptions: {args: ['--disable-popup-blocking']}    recreateChromeDriverSessions  Kill ChromeDriver session when moving to a non-ChromeDriver webview. Defaults to  false  true  or  false    nativeWebScreenshot  In a web context, use native (adb) method for taking a screenshot, rather than proxying to ChromeDriver.

By default the emulator will have this option enabled or not according to how it has been provisioned.  true  or  false    isHeadless  Set this capability to  true  to run the Emulator headless when device display is not needed to be visible.  false  is the default value.  isHeadless  is also support for iOS, check XCUITest-specific capabilities.  e.g.,  true    adbExecTimeout  Timeout in milliseconds used to wait for adb command execution. Defaults to  20000  e.g.,  50000    localeScript  Sets the locale  script  e.g.,  \"Cyrl\"  (Cyrillic)    skipDeviceInitialization  Skip device initialization which includes i.a.: installation and running of Settings app or setting of permissions. Can be used to improve startup performance when the device was already used for automation and it's prepared for the next automation. Defaults to  false  true  or  false    chromedriverDisableBuildCheck  Sets the chromedriver flag  --disable-build-check  for Chrome webview tests  true  or  false    skipUnlock  Skips unlock during session creation. Defaults to  false  true  or  false    unlockType  Unlock the target device with particular lock pattern instead of just waking up the device with a helper app. It works with  unlockKey  capability. Defaults to undefined.  fingerprint  is available only for Android 6.0+ and emulators. Read  unlock doc  in android driver.  ['pin', 'password', 'pattern', 'fingerprint']    unlockKey  A key pattern to unlock used by  unlockType .  e.g., '1111'    autoLaunch  Initializing the app under test automatically. Appium does not install/launch the app under test if this is  false . Defaults to  true  true  or  false    skipLogcatCapture  Skips to start capturing logcat. It might improve performance such as network. Log related commands will not work. Defaults to  false .  true  or  false    uninstallOtherPackages  A package, list of packages or  *  to uninstall package/s before installing apks for test.  '*'  uninstall all of thrid-party packages except for packages which is necessary for Appium to test such as  io.appium.settings  or  io.appium.uiautomator2.server  since Appium already contains the logic to manage them.  e.g.  \"io.appium.example\" ,  [\"io.appium.example1\", \"io.appium.example2\"] ,  '*'    disableWindowAnimation  Set device animation scale zero if the value is  true . After session is complete, Appium restores the animation scale to it's original value. Defaults to  false  true ,  false    remoteAppsCacheLimit  Set the maximum number of remote cached apks (default is 10) which are pushed to the device-under-test's local storage. Caching apks remotely speeds up the execution of sequential test cases, when using the same set of apks, by avoiding the need to be push an apk to the remote file system every time a reinstall is needed. Set this capability to  0  to disable caching.  e.g.  0 ,  5 ,  20    buildToolsVersion  Specify the Android  build-tools  version to be something different than the default, which is to use the most recent version. It is helpful to use a non-default version if your environment uses alpha/beta build tools.  e.g.  '28.0.3'",

You can add a \nwait\n event to control\nthe timing of the gesture.\n\n\nmoveTo\n coordinates are now \nabsolute\n to the current position. For example, dragging from\n100,100 to 200,200 can be achieved by:\n\n\n.press(100,100) // Start at 100,100\n.moveTo(200,200) // Passing absolute values of 200,200 ending up at 200,200\n\n\n\n\n\nThe appium client libraries have different ways of implementing this, for example:\nyou can pass in coordinates or an element to a \nmoveTo\n event. Passing both\ncoordinates \nand\n an element will treat the coordinates as relative to the\nelement's position, rather than absolute.\n\n\nCalling the \nperform\n event sends the entire sequence of events to appium,\nand the touch gesture is run on your device.\n\n\nMultiTouch\n\n\nMultiTouch\n objects are collections of TouchActions.\n\n\nMultiTouch gestures only have two methods, \nadd\n, and \nperform\n.\n\n\nadd\n is used to add another TouchAction to this MultiTouch.\n\n\nWhen \nperform\n is called, all the TouchActions which were added to the\nMultiTouch are sent to appium and performed as if they happened at the\nsame time.

It is possible to directly invoke these\ngestures in Appium starting from version 1.6.4-beta.\n\n\nIt is important to rememeber that XCTest and WDA are being constantly changed.\nThis means all \"mobile: *\" commands can be also subject of change in Appium\nwithout any preliminary notice.\n\n\nmobile: swipe\n\n\nThis gesture performs a simple \"swipe\" gesture on the particular screen element or\non the application element, which is usually the whole screen. This method does not\naccept coordinates and simply emulates single swipe with one finger. It might be\nuseful for such cases like album pagination, switching views, etc. More advanced\ncases may require to call \"mobile: dragFromToForDuration\", where one can supply\ncoordinates and duration.\n\n\nSupported arguments\n\n\n\n\ndirection\n: Either 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right'. The parameter is mandatory\n\n\nelement\n: The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to swipe on.\n Application element will be used instead if this parameter is not provided\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\n// Java\nJavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\nMap\nString, Object\n params = new HashMap\n();\nparams.put(\ndirection\n, \ndown\n);\nparams.put(\nelement\n, ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId());\njs.executeScript(\nmobile: swipe\n, params);\n\n\n\n\nmobile: scroll\n\n\nScrolls the element or the whole screen. Different scrolling strategies are supported.\nArguments define the choosen strategy: either 'name', 'direction', 'predicateString' or\n'toVisible' in that order. All strategies are exclusive and only one strategy\ncan be applied at a single moment of time. Use \"mobile: scroll\" to emulate precise\nscrolling in tables or collection views, where it is already known to which element\nthe scrolling should be performed. Although, there is one known limitation there: in case\nit is necessary to perform too many scroll gestures on parent container to reach the\nnecessary child element (tens of them) then the method call may fail.\n\n\nSupported arguments\n\n\n\n\nelement\n: The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to scroll on.\n Application element will be used if this argument is not set\n\n\nname\n: the accessibility id of the child element, to which scrolling is performed.\n The same result can be achieved by setting \npredicateString\n argument to\n 'name == accessibilityId'. Has no effect if \nelement\n is not a container\n\n\ndirection\n: Either 'up', 'down', 'left' or 'right'. The main difference from\n \nswipe\n call with the same argument is that \nscroll\n will try to move the current viewport\n exactly to the next/previous page (the term \"page\" means the content, which fits into\n a single device screen)\n\n\npredicateString\n: the NSPredicate locator of the child element, to which\n the scrolling should be performed. Has no effect if \nelement\n is not a container\n\n\ntoVisible\n: Boolean parameter. If set to \ntrue\n then asks to scroll to\n the first visible \nelement\n in the parent container. Has no effect if \nelement\n is\n not set\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\n# Python\ndriver.execute_script('mobile: scroll', {'direction': 'down'});\n\n\n\n\nmobile: pinch\n\n\nPerforms pinch gesture on the given element or on the application element.\n\n\nSupported arguments\n\n\n\n\nelement\n: The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to pinch on.\n Application element will be used instead if this parameter is not provided\n\n\nscale\n: Pinch scale of type float. Use a scale between 0 and 1 to \"pinch close\" or\n zoom out and a scale greater than 1 to \"pinch open\" or zoom in. Mandatory parameter\n\n\nvelocity\n: The velocity of the pinch in scale factor per second (float value). Mandatory parameter\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\n# Ruby\nexecute_script 'mobile: pinch', scale: 0.5, velocity: 1.1, element: element.ref\n\n\n\n\nmobile: doubleTap\n\n\nPerforms double tap gesture on the given element or on the screen.\n\n\nSupported arguments\n\n\n\n\nelement\n: The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to double tap on\n\n\nx\n: Screen x tap coordinate of type float. Mandatory parameter only if \nelement\n is not set\n\n\ny\n: Screen y tap coordinate of type float. Mandatory parameter only if \nelement\n is not set\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\n// javascript\ndriver.execute('mobile: doubleTap', {element: element.value.ELEMENT});\n\n\n\n\nmobile: touchAndHold\n\n\nPerforms long press gesture on the given element or on the screen.\n\n\nSupported arguments\n\n\n\n\nelement\n: The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to long tap on\n\n\nduration\n: The float duration of press action in seconds. Mandatory patameter\n\n\nx\n: Screen x long tap coordinate of type float. Mandatory parameter only if \nelement\n is not set\n\n\ny\n: Screen y long tap coordinate of type float.

Otherwise they should be calculated\n relatively to screen borders.\n\n\nx\n: x tap coordinate of type float. Mandatory parameter\n\n\ny\n: y tap coordinate of type float. Mandatory parameter\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\n// PHP\n$params = array(array('x' =\n 100.0, 'y' =\n 50.0, 'element' =\n element.GetAttribute(\nid\n)));\n$driver-\nexecuteScript(\nmobile: tap\n, $params);\n\n\n\n\nmobile: dragFromToForDuration\n\n\nPerforms drag and drop gesture by coordinates. This can be done either on an element or\non the screen\n\n\nSupported arguments\n\n\n\n\nelement\n: The internal element identifier (as hexadecimal hash string) to perform drag on.\n All the coordinates will be calculated relatively this this element position on the screen.\n Absolute screen coordinates are expected if this argument is not set\n\n\nduration\n: Float number of seconds in range [0.5, 60]. How long the tap gesture at\n starting drag point should be before to start dragging. Mandatory parameter\n\n\nfromX\n: The x coordinate of starting drag point (type float). Mandatory parameter\n\n\nfromY\n: The y coordinate of starting drag point (type float). Mandatory parameter\n\n\ntoX\n: The x coordinate of ending drag point (type float). Mandatory parameter\n\n\ntoY\n: The y coordinate of ending drag point (type float). Mandatory parameter\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\n// Java\nJavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\nMap\nString, Object\n params = new HashMap\n();\nparams.put(\nduration\n, 1.0);\nparams.put(\nfromX\n, 100);\nparams.put(\nfromY\n, 100);\nparams.put(\ntoX\n, 200);\nparams.put(\ntoY\n, 200);\nparams.put(\nelement\n, ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId());\njs.executeScript(\nmobile: dragFromToForDuration\n, params);\n\n\n\n\nmobile: selectPickerWheelValue\n\n\nPerforms selection of the next or previous picker wheel value. This might\nbe useful if these values are populated dynamically, so you don't know which\none to select or value selection does not work because of XCTest bug.\n\n\nSupported arguments\n\n\n\n\nelement\n: PickerWheel's internal element id (as hexadecimal hash string) to perform\n value selection on. The element must be of type XCUIElementTypePickerWheel. Mandatory parameter\n\n\norder\n: Either \nnext\n to select the value next to the current one\n from the target picker wheel or \nprevious\n to select the previous one. Mandatory parameter\n\n\noffset\n: The value in range [0.01, 0.5]. It defines how far from picker\n wheel's center the click should happen. The actual distance is calculated by\n multiplying this value to the actual picker wheel height. Too small offset value\n may not change the picker wheel value and too high value may cause the wheel to switch\n two or more values at once. Usually the optimal value is located in range [0.15, 0.3]. \n0.2\n by default\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\n// Java\nJavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor) driver;\nMap\nString, Object\n params = new HashMap\n();\nparams.put(\norder\n, \nnext\n);\nparams.put(\noffset\n, 0.15);\nparams.put(\nelement\n, ((RemoteWebElement) element).getId());\njs.executeScript(\nmobile: selectPickerWheelValue\n, params);\n\n\n\n\nmobile: alert\n\n\nPerforms operations on NSAlert instance.\n\n\nSupported arguments\n\n\n\n\naction\n: The following actions are supported: \naccept\n, \ndismiss\n and \ngetButtons\n.\n Mandatory parameter\n\n\nbuttonLabel\n: The label text of an existing alert button to click on. This is an\n optional parameter and is only valid in combination with \naccept\n and \ndismiss\n\n actions.\n\n\n\n\nUsage examples\n\n\n# Python\ndriver.execute_script('mobile: alert', {'action': 'accept', 'buttonLabel': 'My Cool Alert Button'});\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Topics\n\n\nCheck \nWDA Element Commands API\n\nto get the information about the gestures implemented in Facebook WebDriverAgent.\nCheck Apple XCTest documentation on \nXCUIElement\n and\n\nXCUICoordinate\n methods list to get the information\nabout all gestures available there.",

The AdapterView has \"adapter\" object which stores all the data for that view's children, including the views that aren't being rendered.\n\n\nWhen using Espresso's Data Matcher, you can target views that are off-screen by writing a \nHamcrest matcher\n that selects an item from an adapter.

Here's a code snippet that shows how to locate and click \nTextClock\n:\n\n\n// Javascript example\ndriver.findElementById(\nlist\n)\n  .findElement(\n-android datamatcher\n, JSON.stringify({\n    \nname\n: \nhasEntry\n,\n    \nargs\n: [\ntitle\n, \nTextClock\n]\n  }))\n  .click();\n\n\n\n\n# Ruby\n@driver.find_element(:id, 'list')\n  .find_element(:data_matcher, {\n    name: 'hasEntry',\n    args: ['title', 'TextClock']\n  }.to_json)\n  .click\n\n\n\n\n# Python\ndriver.find_element_by_id('list')\n    .find_element_by_android_data_matcher({\n        name='hasEntry',\n        args=['title', 'TextClock']\n    })\n    .click()\n\n\n\n\nThis Appium selector is equivalent to writing this matcher in Espresso:\n\n\n// Espresso code (not Appium code)\nonData(hasEntry(\ntitle\n, \ntextClock\n)\n  .inAdapterView(withId(\nandroid:id/list))\n  .perform(click());\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, we select the parent \nAdapterView\n using an id selector and then find a child of that view by applying a Hamcrest Matcher that matches an object with \ntitle=\"TextClock\"\n.\n\n\nLocating the parent \nAdapterView\n is not necessary if the Activity only has one adapter view. In that case, it can be omitted.\n\n\ndriver.findElement(\n-android datamatcher\n, JSON.stringify({\n    \nname\n: \nhasEntry\n,\n    \nargs\n: [\ntitle\n, \nTextClock\n]\n  }))\n  .click();\n\n\n\n\n# Ruby\n@driver.find_element(:data_matcher, {\n  name: 'hasEntry',\n  args: ['title', 'TextClock']\n}.to_json).click\n\n\n\n\n# Python\ndriver.find_element_by_android_data_matcher({\n    name='hasEntry',\n    args=['title', 'TextClock']\n}).click()\n\n\n\n\nWriting the Selector\n\n\nThe data matcher selector uses Java reflection to invoke a \nHamcrest matcher\n that's used to locate the adapter object. The matcher is in JSON format and has this format\n\n\n{\n  \nname\n: \nMETHOD_NAME\n,\n  \nargs\n: [...],\n\n\n\n\nThe name is a Hamcrest matcher method name. This defaults to the \norg.hamcrest.Matchers\n namespace, but fully qualifed matcher method names can be used too (e.g.: \nandroid.support.test.espresso.matcher.CursorMatchers.withRowBlob\n).\n\n\nThe args are a list of args that the method takes (can be undefined if it takes no args). These can be strings, numbers, booleans or other hamcrest matcher JSON definitions.\n\n\nJSON matcher samples\n\n\nExamples of JSON matchers with the equivalent Espresso \nonData\n matcher\n\n\nStartsWith\n\n\n// 'startsWith' JSON\n{\n  \nname\n: \nstartsWith\n,\n  \nargs\n: \nsubstr\n // if it's a single arg, we don't need args to be an array\n}\n\n\n\n\n// Espresso 'startsWith' example\nonData(startsWith(\nsubstr\n));\n\n\n\n\nMultiple Matchers\n\n\n// 'multiple matchers' JSON\n{\n  \nname\n: \nallOf\n,\n  \nargs\n: [\n    {\nname\n: \ninstanceOf\n, \nargs\n: \nMap.class\n},\n    {\nname\n: \nhasEntry\n, \nargs\n: {\n      \nname\n: \nequalTo\n, \nargs\n: \nSTR\n\n    }},\n    {\nname\n: \nis\n, \nargs\n: \nitem: 50\n}\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n// Espresso 'multiple matchers' example\nonData(allOf(is(instanceOf(Map.class)), hasEntry(equalTo(\nSTR\n), is(\nitem: 50\n))));\n\n\n\n\nCursor Matchers\n\n\n// 'cursor matchers' JSON\n{\n  \nname\n: \nis\n, \nargs\n: {\n    \nname\n: \ninstanceOf\n, \nargs\n: \nCursor.class\n\n  },\n  \nname\n: \nCursorMatchers.withRowString\n, \nargs\n: [\n    \njob_title\n, {\nname\n: \nis\n, \nargs\n: \nBarista\n}\n  ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n// Espresso 'cursor matchers' example\nonData(\n    is(instanceOf(Cursor.class)),\n    CursorMatchers.withRowString(\njob_title\n, is(\nBarista\n))\n);\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of Views vs. Data in Espresso\n\n\nEspresso lists",

Unlike programming paradigms in which apps are launched with a main() method, the Android system initiates code in an Activity instance by invoking specific callback methods that correspond to specific stages of its lifecycle.\n\n \nAndroid Developer Documentation\n\n\n\n\nAppium needs to know package and activity names in order to properly initialize the application under test. This information is expected to be provided in driver capabilities and consists of the following keys:\n\n\n\n\nappActivity\n: The name of the main application activity\n\n\nappPackage\n: The identifier of the application package\n\n\nappWaitActivity\n: The name of the application activity to wait for/which starts the first\n\n\nappWaitPackage\n: The id of the application package to wait for/which starts the first\n\n\nappWaitDuration\n: The maximum duration to wait until the \nappWaitActivity\n is focused in milliseconds (20000 by default)\n\n\n\n\nAll these capabilities are optional. If they are not set explicitly then Appium tries to auto detect them by reading their values from the APK manifest. Although, if the application under test is supposed to be already installed on the device (\nnoReset=true\n) then at least \nappActivity\n and \nappPackage\n options are required to be set, since no package manifest is available in such case. If you don't set \nappWaitPackage\n and \nappWaitActivity\n explicitly then these are getting assigned to \nappPackage\n/\nappActivity\n values automatically. For more details check on the implementation of \npackageAndLaunchActivityFromManifest\n method in the \nappium-adb\n package.\n\n\nHow Appium Starts Activities\n\n\nActivities are started by \nCall activity manager \nam\n. Appium tries to start the \nappPackage\n/\nappActivity\n combination using \nam start\n and then waits until the \nappWaitPackage\n/\nappWaitActivity\n is focused or the \nappWaitDuration\n timeout expires. The currently focused activity name is parsed from \nadb shell dumpsys window windows\n command output (\nmFocusedApp\n or \nmCurrentFocus\n entries). For more details check on the implementation of \nstartApp\n, and \ngetFocusedPackageAndActivity\n methods in the \nappium-adb\n package.\n\n\nPossible Problems And Solutions\n\n\njava.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: starting Intent\n\n\nThe full error description usually looks like \n'java.lang.SecurityException: Permission Denial: starting Intent { act=android.intent.action.MAIN cat=[android.intent.category.LAUNCHER] flg=0x10200000 cmp=com.mypackage/.myactivity.MainActivity launchParam=MultiScreenLaunchParams { mDisplayId=0 mBaseDisplayId=0 mFlags=0 } } from null (pid=11366, uid=2000) not exported from uid 10191\n. Such error might be the indication of the fact that the combination of application package and activity name, which has been passed to Appium as \nappPackage\n/\nappActivity\n (or auto detected implicitly), is not the correct one to start the application under test. As a solution, it is necessary to check the correct values with the application developer and test them manually first by executing: \nadb shell am start -W -n com.myfixedpackage/.myfixedactivity.MainActivity -S -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER -f 0x10200000\n. If this commands succeeds manually and starts the necessary application on the device then it will work for Appium as well.\n\n\ncom.myactivity or com.myapp.com.myactivity never started\n\n\nThus exception usually indicates, that the first application activity is not the same package/activity, as it is set (or auto detected) by \nappWaitPackage\n/\nappWaitActivity\n. Such error normally happens in applications having multiple activities. In order to resolve the problem one should check with application developer regarding which activity/package is the very first one that appears on application startup. The currently focused activity name might be verified using the \nadb shell dumpsys window windows\n command mentioned above. Also, Appium allows to use wildcards while setting \nappWaitActivity\n value. This might be particularly useful if the activity name is generated dynamically or it is not the same all the time. For example \ncom.mycomany.*\n will match any of \ncom.mycomany.foo\n, \ncom.mycomany.bar\n.\n\n\nIf you've double checked that activity names are correct, but the startup still times out, then try to increase the value of \nappWaitDuration\n capability. Normally, the default 20 seconds is enough for the most of applications, however, some bigger apps might require more time to start and show the first activity. Please, don't create such apps.",

Although, if the application under test is supposed to be already installed on the device ( noReset=true ) then at least  appActivity  and  appPackage  options are required to be set, since no package manifest is available in such case. If you don't set  appWaitPackage  and  appWaitActivity  explicitly then these are getting assigned to  appPackage / appActivity  values automatically.

Such error might be the indication of the fact that the combination of application package and activity name, which has been passed to Appium as  appPackage / appActivity  (or auto detected implicitly), is not the correct one to start the application under test. As a solution, it is necessary to check the correct values with the application developer and test them manually first by executing:  adb shell am start -W -n com.myfixedpackage/.myfixedactivity.MainActivity -S -a android.intent.action.MAIN -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER -f 0x10200000 .

The currently focused activity name might be verified using the  adb shell dumpsys window windows  command mentioned above. Also, Appium allows to use wildcards while setting  appWaitActivity  value. This might be particularly useful if the activity name is generated dynamically or it is not the same all the time. For example  com.mycomany.*  will match any of  com.mycomany.foo ,  com.mycomany.bar .  If you've double checked that activity names are correct, but the startup still times out, then try to increase the value of  appWaitDuration  capability.

Make sure you install the build-tools and platform-tools.\n\n\n\n\nAndroid\n\n\n\n\nMake sure the Android emulator is up and running.\n\n\nIt's sometimes useful to run \nadb kill-server \n adb devices\n. This can\n  reset the connection to the Android device.\n\n\nIf you're running the Android emulator using Fastboot and the emulator isn't being detected by adb, try doing a cold boot:  \nAndroid Studio \n Tools \n AVD Manager \n Actions \n Cold Boot Now\n\n\nMake sure you set ANDROID_HOME pointing to the Android SDK directory\n\n\nAfter setting power state to \noff\n (e.g.: \ndriver.setPowerAC(PowerACState.OFF);\n) you must create a new session.\n\n\nWhen using \n-wipe-data\n in \navdArgs\n the \nnoReset\n capability will be ignored if set to true.\n\n\n\n\nAndroid Espresso\n\n\n\n\nAppium is supposed to disable animations by default, but if it doesn't work try following the \nEspresso setup instructions\n which advises that \"To avoid flakiness, we highly recommend that you turn off system animations on the virtual or physical devices used for testing. On your device, under Settings \n Developer options, disable the following 3 settings: Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, Animator Duration scale\"\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\n\n\n\nMake sure developer mode is on\n\n\nMake sure command prompt is Admin\n\n\nCheck that the URL Appium server is listening to matches the one specified in test script\n\n\n\n\nIOS\n\n\n\n\nMake sure Instruments.app is not open\n\n\nIf you're running the simulator, make sure your actual device is not\n  plugged in\n\n\nMake sure the accessibility helper is turned off in your Settings app\n\n\nMake sure the app is compiled for the version of the simulator that's being\n  run\n\n\nMake sure the app is compiled for the simulator (or real device) as\n  appropriate (e.g., in debug mode for the simulator), or you might get\n  a \nposix spawn\n error.\n\n\nIf you've ever run Appium with sudo, you might need to \nsudo rm\n  /tmp/instruments_sock\n and try again as not-sudo.\n\n\nIf this is the first time you've run Appium, make sure to authorize the use\n  of Instruments. See the \nUIAutomation Driver\n doc.\n\n\nIf Instruments is crashing when running against a physical device (\"exited with code 253\"), ensure Xcode has downloaded device symbols. Go to Window -\n Devices, and it should start automatically. This is needed after iOS version upgrades.\n\n\nIf you see \niOS Simulator failed to install the application.\n and the\n  paths are correct, try restarting the computer.\n\n\nMake sure your macOS keychain that holds the certificate(s) needed for building your app and the WebDriverAgent is unlocked. Especialy if you are using ssh. General symptom to look for is \ncodesign\n failure.\n\n\nIf you have custom elements in your app, they will not be automatable by\n  UIAutomation (and therefore Appium) by default. You need to set the\n  accessibility status to 'enabled' on them. The way to do this in code is:\n\n\n\n\ncenter\n  [myCustomView setAccessibilityEnabled:YES];\n\n\n\n\nTests on iOS may exhibit symptoms similar to a memory leak including sluggish\n  performance or hangs. If you experience this problem, it's likely due to a\n  known issue with NSLog. One option is to remove NSLog from your code.\n  However, there are several more nuanced approaches that may also help without\n  requiring that you refactor.\n\n\n\n\n### Workaround 1\n  NSLog is a macro and can be redefined. E.g.,\n  ```objectivec\n  // \nYou'll need to define TEST or TEST2 and then recompile.\n\n\n#ifdef TEST\n    #define NSLog(...) _BlackHoleTestLogger(\nVA_ARGS\n);\n  #endif // TEST\n  #ifdef TEST2\n    #define NSLog(...) _StdoutTestLogger(\nVA_ARGS\n);\n  #endif // TEST2\n\n\nvoid _BlackHoleTestLogger(NSString *format, ...) {\n      //\n  }\n\n\nvoid _StdoutTestLogger(NSString *format, ...) {\n      va_list argumentList;\n      va_start(argumentList, format);\n      NSMutableString * message = [[NSMutableString alloc] initWithFormat:format\n                                                  arguments:argumentList];\n\n\n  printf(message);\n\n  va_end(argumentList);\n  [message release];\n\n\n\n}\n  ```\n\n\n### Workaround 2\n  Manually replace the underlying function that NSLog wraps. This method was recommended by\n  \nApple in a similar context.\n\n\n```objectivec\n  extern void _NSSetLogCStringFunction(void(\n)(const char \n, unsigned, BOOL));\n\n\nstatic void _GarbageFreeLogCString(const char *message, unsigned length, BOOL withSyslogBanner) {\n     fprintf(stderr, \"%s\\n\", message);\n  }\n\n\nint main (int argc, const char \nargv[]) {\n     NSAutoreleasePool \npool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];\n     int exitCode;\n\n\n setbuf(stderr, NULL);\n\n _NSSetLogCStringFunction(_GarbageFreeLogCString);\n exitCode = WOApplicationMain(@\"Application\", argc, argv);\n [pool release];\n return exitCode;\n\n\n\n}\n  \n``\n* Get\nUnable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: Command 'Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d' exited with code 1\nerror message in failing xcodebuild\n    - Make sure\nxcodebuild -checkFirstLaunchStatus\nreturns status code\n0\n- If it returns\n69\n, you should call\nxcodebuild -runFirstLaunch\nonce to prevent the root error,\nInstall Started\nInstall Failed: Error Domain=DVTDownloadableErrors Code=3 \"The authorization was denied since no user interaction was possible.\" UserInfo={AuthorizationErrorCode=-60007, NSLocalizedDescription=The authorization was denied since no user interaction was possible.}`\n    - example: https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent/pull/165#discussion_r281458167\n\n\nWebview/Hybrid/Safari app support\n\n\n\n\nMake Sure you enable the 'Web Inspector' on the real device.\n\n\nMake Sure you enable the Safari - Advance Preferences- Developer menu for\n  simulators.\n\n\nMake sure you are properly switching contexts using the \ncontext\n appium commands provided by your client library.\n\n\nIf you getting this error: select_port() failed, when trying to open the\n  proxy, see this \ndiscussion\n\n\nIn a Safari session, if the logs indicate that the initial url cannot be entered, make sure that\n  you have the software keyboard enabled.

If this is the first time you've run Appium, make sure to authorize the use\n  of Instruments. See the  UIAutomation Driver  doc.  If Instruments is crashing when running against a physical device (\"exited with code 253\"), ensure Xcode has downloaded device symbols. Go to Window -  Devices, and it should start automatically.

General symptom to look for is  codesign  failure.  If you have custom elements in your app, they will not be automatable by\n  UIAutomation (and therefore Appium) by default. You need to set the\n  accessibility status to 'enabled' on them. The way to do this in code is:   center\n  [myCustomView setAccessibilityEnabled:YES];   Tests on iOS may exhibit symptoms similar to a memory leak including sluggish\n  performance or hangs. If you experience this problem, it's likely due to a\n  known issue with NSLog. One option is to remove NSLog from your code.\n  However, there are several more nuanced approaches that may also help without\n  requiring that you refactor.   ### Workaround 1\n  NSLog is a macro and can be redefined. E.g.,\n  ```objectivec\n  //  You'll need to define TEST or TEST2 and then recompile.  #ifdef TEST\n    #define NSLog(...) _BlackHoleTestLogger( VA_ARGS );\n  #endif // TEST\n  #ifdef TEST2\n    #define NSLog(...) _StdoutTestLogger( VA_ARGS );\n  #endif // TEST2  void _BlackHoleTestLogger(NSString *format, ...) {\n      //\n  }  void _StdoutTestLogger(NSString *format, ...) {\n      va_list argumentList;\n      va_start(argumentList, format);\n      NSMutableString * message = [[NSMutableString alloc] initWithFormat:format\n                                                  arguments:argumentList];    printf(message);\n\n  va_end(argumentList);\n  [message release];  }\n  ```  ### Workaround 2\n  Manually replace the underlying function that NSLog wraps. This method was recommended by\n   Apple in a similar context.  ```objectivec\n  extern void _NSSetLogCStringFunction(void( )(const char  , unsigned, BOOL));  static void _GarbageFreeLogCString(const char *message, unsigned length, BOOL withSyslogBanner) {\n     fprintf(stderr, \"%s\\n\", message);\n  }  int main (int argc, const char  argv[]) {\n     NSAutoreleasePool  pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];\n     int exitCode;   setbuf(stderr, NULL);\n\n _NSSetLogCStringFunction(_GarbageFreeLogCString);\n exitCode = WOApplicationMain(@\"Application\", argc, argv);\n [pool release];\n return exitCode;  }\n   ``\n* Get Unable to launch WebDriverAgent because of xcodebuild failure: Command 'Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d' exited with code 1 error message in failing xcodebuild\n    - Make sure xcodebuild -checkFirstLaunchStatus returns status code 0 - If it returns 69 , you should call xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch once to prevent the root error, Install Started\nInstall Failed: Error Domain=DVTDownloadableErrors Code=3 \"The authorization was denied since no user interaction was possible.\" UserInfo={AuthorizationErrorCode=-60007, NSLocalizedDescription=The authorization was denied since no user interaction was possible.}`\n    - example: https://github.com/appium/WebDriverAgent/pull/165#discussion_r281458167",

            "text": "Finding and Interacting with Image Elements\n\n\nUsing the experimental \n-image\n locator strategy, it is possible to send an Appium an image file representing an element you want to tap. If Appium can find a screen region matching your template, it will wrap up information about this region as a standard \nWebElement\n and send it back to your Appium client.\n\n\nThe strategy will be made available differently for each Appium client, for example: \ndriver.findElementByImage()\n.\n\n\nImage Selectors\n\n\nIn conjunction with any locator strategy, you need to use a \"selector\" which details the specific nature of your find request. In the case of the \n-image\n strategy, the selector must be a string which is a base64-encoded image file representing the template you want to use for matching.\n\n\nImage Elements\n\n\nIf the image match is successful, Appium will cache information about the match and create a standard response for your client to consume, resulting in the instantiation of a standard element object in your test script. Using this element object, you are able to call a small number of methods on the \"Image Element\", as if it were a bona-fide \nWebElement\n:\n\n\n\n\nclick\n\n\nisDisplayed\n\n\ngetSize\n\n\ngetLocation\n\n\ngetLocationInView\n\n\ngetElementRect\n\n\ngetAttribute\n (only \nvisual\n attribute)\n\n\n\n\nThese actions are supported on \"Image Elements\" because they are the actions which involve only use of screen position for their functioning. Other actions (like \nsendKeys\n, for example) are not supported, because all Appium can know based on your template image is whether or not there is a screen region which visually matches it--Appium has no way of turning that information into a driver-specific UI element object, which would be necessary for the use of other actions.\n\n\nIt's important to keep this important point in mind: there is nothing \"magic\" about Image Elements---they merely reference screen coordinates, and thus \"tapping\" an Image Element is internally nothing more than Appium constructing a tap at a point in the center of the Image Element's screen bounds (and in fact you can tell Appium which API to use to perform that tap---see below).\n\n\nRelated Settings\n\n\nBecause finding elements by image relies on image analysis software in conjunction with Appium's screenshot functionality and the reference images you yourself provide, we provide a number of settings that help you modulate this feature, in some cases potentially speeding up the match or making it more accurate.\n\n\nTo access these settings, you should use the Appium \nSettings API\n. These are the settings that are available:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting Name\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nPossible Values\n\n\nDefault Value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimageMatchThreshold\n\n\nThe OpenCV match threshold below which to consider the find a failure. Basically the range of possibilities is between 0 (which means no threshold should be used) and 1 (which means that the reference image must be an exact pixel-for-pixel match). The exact values in between have no absolute meaning. For example a match that requires drastic resizing of a reference image will come out as a lower match strength than otherwise. It's recommended you try the default setting, and then incrementally lower the threshold if you're not finding matching elements. If you're matching the wrong element, try increasing the threshold value.\n\n\nNumbers from 0 to 1\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfixImageFindScreenshotDims\n\n\nAppium knows the screen dimensions, and ultimately these are the dimensions which are relevant for deciding where to tap on the screen. If the screenshot retrieved (via Appium's native methods, or an external source) does not match the screen dimensions, this setting dictates that Appium will adjust the size of the screenshot to match, ensuring that matched elements are found at the correct coordinates. Turn this setting off if you know it's not necessary, and Appium will forego the check, potentially speeding things up a bit.\n\n\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfixImageTemplateSize\n\n\nOpenCV will not allow the matching of a reference image / template if that image is larger than the base image to match against. It can happen that the reference image you send in has dimensions which are larger than the screenshot Appium retrieves. In this case the match will automatically fail. If you set this setting to \ntrue\n, Appium will resize the template to ensure it is at least smaller than the size of the screenshot.\n\n\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfixImageTemplateScale\n\n\nAppium resizes a base image to fit its window size before matching them with OpenCV. If you set this setting to \ntrue\n, Appium scales a reference image you send in as the same scale Appium scales the base image to fit the window size. e.g. iOS screenshot is \n750 \u00d7 1334\n pixels base image. The window size is \n375 x 667\n. Appium rescale the base image to window size scaling it with \n0.5\n. A reference image is based on the screenshot size, never the image matches with the window size scale. This settings allow Appium to scale the reference image with \n0.5\n. \nappium-base-driver#306\n\n\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndefaultImageTemplateScale\n\n\nAppium does not resize template images by default (the value of 1.0). Although, storing scaled template images might help to save size of the storage. E.g. One has could represent 1080 \u00d7 126 pixels area by 270 \u00d7 32 pixels template image (the value of defaultImageTemplateScale is expected to be set to 4.0). Check \nappium-base-driver#307\n for more details.\n\n\ne.g., \n0.5\n, \n10.0\n, \n100\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncheckForImageElementStaleness\n\n\nIt can happen that, in between the time you have matched an image element and the time you choose to tap on it, the element is no longer present. The only way for Appium to determine this is to attempt to re-match the template immediately before tapping. If that re-match fails, you will get a \nStaleElementException\n, as you would expect. Turn this to \nfalse\n to skip the check, potentially speeding things up, but potentially running into stale element issues without the benefit of an exception to let you know you did.\n\n\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\nautoUpdateImageElementPosition\n\n\nIt can happen that a matched image changes position in between the time it is found and the time you tap on it. As with the previous setting, Appium can automatically adjust its position if it determines in a re-match that the position changed.\n\n\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimageElementTapStrategy\n\n\nIn order to tap on a found image element, Appium has to use one of its touch action strategies. The available strategies are the W3C Actions API, or the older MJSONWP TouchActions API. Stick to the default unless the driver you are using does not support the W3C Actions API for some reason.\n\n\n\"w3cActions\"\n or \n\"touchActions\"\n\n\n\"w3cActions\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngetMatchedImageResult\n\n\nAppium does not store the matched image result. Although, storing the result in memory might help for debugging whether which area is matched by find by image. Appium returns the image against \nattribute\n API as \nvisual\n.\n\n\ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that each language-specific Appium client may make these settings available via special constants which could differ slightly from the exact setting names mentioned above.\n\n\nDebug\n\n\ngetMatchedImageResult\n might help for debugging if Appium found the provided image expectedly. \nvisual\n attribute returns base64 data if \ngetMatchedImageResult\n is \ntrue\n.\n\n\n# Ruby core\n@driver.update_settings({ getMatchedImageResult: false })\nel = @driver.find_element_by_image 'path/to/img.ong'\nimg_el.visual # returns base64 encoded string\n\n\n\n\n# Python\nself.driver.update_settings({\ngetMatchedImageResult\n: True}))\nel = self.driver.find_element_by_image('path/to/img.ong')\nel.get_attribute('visual') # returns base64 encoded string\n\n\n\n\nreference: https://github.com/appium/appium-base-driver/pull/327",

This settings allow Appium to scale the reference image with  0.5 .  appium-base-driver#306  true  or  false  false    defaultImageTemplateScale  Appium does not resize template images by default (the value of 1.0). Although, storing scaled template images might help to save size of the storage. E.g. One has could represent 1080 \u00d7 126 pixels area by 270 \u00d7 32 pixels template image (the value of defaultImageTemplateScale is expected to be set to 4.0). Check  appium-base-driver#307  for more details.  e.g.,  0.5 ,  10.0 ,  100  1.0    checkForImageElementStaleness  It can happen that, in between the time you have matched an image element and the time you choose to tap on it, the element is no longer present. The only way for Appium to determine this is to attempt to re-match the template immediately before tapping. If that re-match fails, you will get a  StaleElementException , as you would expect. Turn this to  false  to skip the check, potentially speeding things up, but potentially running into stale element issues without the benefit of an exception to let you know you did.  true  or  false  true    autoUpdateImageElementPosition  It can happen that a matched image changes position in between the time it is found and the time you tap on it. As with the previous setting, Appium can automatically adjust its position if it determines in a re-match that the position changed.  true  or  false  false    imageElementTapStrategy  In order to tap on a found image element, Appium has to use one of its touch action strategies. The available strategies are the W3C Actions API, or the older MJSONWP TouchActions API. Stick to the default unless the driver you are using does not support the W3C Actions API for some reason.  \"w3cActions\"  or  \"touchActions\"  \"w3cActions\"    getMatchedImageResult  Appium does not store the matched image result. Although, storing the result in memory might help for debugging whether which area is matched by find by image. Appium returns the image against  attribute  API as  visual .  true  or  false  false     Note that each language-specific Appium client may make these settings available via special constants which could differ slightly from the exact setting names mentioned above.",

This is an experimental feature.\n\n\nUsage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou install a third-party element finding plugin which has been developed according to the Appium element finding plugin standard (see below). (It must, therefore, be a Node module, whether installed via NPM or referenced locally). You can install this plugin wherever you like on your system, though there are three basic options:\n\n\n\n\nA directory you manage separately from Appium (by running \nnpm install \nplugin\n in an arbitrary folder)\n\n\nInside the Appium dependency tree itself (by running \nnpm install \nplugin\n inside the Appium root directory)\n\n\nGlobally on your system (by running \nnpm install -g \nplugin\n)\n\n\n\n\n(Of course, the plugin itself might have its own additional installation or setup instructions, which would be detailed in the plugin's docs.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou add a new capability to your test: \ncustomFindModules\n. This capability must be an object with at least one key and one value. The key is called the \"plugin shortcut\", and the value is called the \"plugin reference\". In this example:\n\n\n{\n    \"customFindModules\": {\n        \"plug\": \"my-element-finding-plugin\"\n    }\n}\n\n\n\"plug\" is the shortcut, and \"my-element-finding-plugin\" is the reference.\nYou will use the shortcut in your own test code, so it can be any string\nwhich is a valid JSON key. The reference must be a reference to the plugin's\nNode module, and it must be formatted in such a way that Appium can\n\nrequire\n it using\nNode's \nmodule resolution\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you've started a session with this capability, we say that the plugin (or plugins---multiple plugins are of course supported) are \nregistered\n. You can find an element using a registered plugin by doing two things:\n\n\n\n\nUsing the \n-custom\n locator strategy\n\n\nPrefixing your selector with \nshortcut\n:\n\n\n\n\nSo with the example plugin above, if I wanted to find an element using the selector \"foo\", it would look like this (in imaginary client code):\n\n\ndriver.findElement('-custom', 'plug:foo');\n\n\n\n\nIn other words, I'm using the \n-custom\n locator strategy, and sending in the selector \nfoo\n, making sure Appium knows that it is specifically the \nplug\n plugin which should handle the find request.\n\n\nIn the case where only one plugin is registered, you can omit the shortcut in the selector (since Appium will not be confused about which plugin you want to use):\n\n\ndriver.findElement('-custom', 'foo');\n\n\n\n\nThe \n-custom\n locator strategy is not well supported in all Appium clients at this point; check client documentation for the correct invocation for this strategy.\n\n\nDeveloping a Plugin\n\n\nAnyone can develop an element finding plugin for Appium. The only rules are as follows:\n\n\n\n\nThe plugin must be a Node module which has a named export called \nfind\n\n\nThis method, when called, must return a (possibly empty) array of element objects\n\n\n\n\nWhen Appium calls your \nfind\n method, it will pass the following parameters:\n\n\n\n\nAn instance of the \ndriver\n object representing the current session (this would be, for example an instance of \nXCUITestDriver\n)\n\n\nA logging object which you can use to write logs into the Appium log\n\n\nThe selector (a string) the user of your plugin has sent for the purpose of finding the element\n\n\nA boolean value: whether the user is looking for multiple elements (true) or not (false). Note that you must always return an array, regardless of whether the user needs more than one element. This flag is passed in case it is useful for optimizing searches that do not require multiple elements returned.\n\n\n\n\nThat's all there is to it!

            "text": "Migrating your iOS tests from UIAutomation (iOS 9.3 and below) to XCUITest (iOS 9.3 and up)\n\n\nFor iOS automation, Appium relies on system frameworks provided by Apple. For iOS 9.2 and below, Apple's only automation technology was called UIAutomation, and it ran in the context of a process called \"Instruments\". As of iOS 10, Apple has completely removed the UIAutomation instrument, thus making it impossible for Appium to allow testing in the way it used to. Fortunately, Apple introduced a new automation technology, called XCUITest, beginning with iOS 9.3. For iOS 10 and up, this will be the only supported automation framework from Apple.\n\n\nAppium has built in support for XCUITest beginning with Appium 1.6. For the most part, the capabilities of XCUITest match those of UIAutomation, and so the Appium team was able to ensure that test behavior will stay the same. This is one of the great things about using Appium! Even with Apple completely changing the technology your tests are using, your scripts can stay mostly the same! That being said, there are some differences you'll need to be aware of which might require modification of your test scripts if you want to run them under our XCUITest automation backend. This document will help you with those differences.\n\n\nElement class name schema\n\n\nWith XCUITest, Apple has given different class names to the UI elements which make up the view hierarchy. For example, \nUIAButton\n is now \nXCUIElementTypeButton\n. In many cases, there is a direct mapping between these two classes. If you use the \nclass name\n locator strategy to find elements, Appium 1.6 will rewrite the selector for you. Likewise, if you use the \nxpath\n locator strategy, Appium 1.6 will find any \nUIA*\n elements in your XPath string and rewrite them appropriately.\n\n\nThis does not however guarantee that your tests will work exactly the same, for two reasons:\n\n\n\n\nThe application hierarchy reported to Appium will not necessarily be identical within XCUITest to what it was within UIAutomation. If you have a path-based XPath selector, it may need to be adjusted.\n\n\nThe list of class names is not entirely identical either. Many elements are returned by XCUITest as belonging to the \nXCUIElementTypeOther\n class, a sort of catch-all container.\n\n\n\n\nPage source\n\n\nAs mentioned just above, if you rely on the app source XML from the \npage source\n command, the XML output will now differ significantly from what it was under UIAutomation.\n\n\n-ios uiautomation\n locator strategy\n\n\nThis locator strategy was specifically built on UIAutomation, so it is not included in the XCUITest automation backend. We will be working on a similar \"native\"-type locator strategy in coming releases.\n\n\nxpath\n locator strategy\n\n\n\n\nTry not to use XPath locators unless there is absolutely no other alternative. In general, xpath locators might be many times slower than other types of locators like accessibility id, class name and predicate (up to 100 times slower in some special cases). They are so slow, because xpath location is not natively supported by Apple's XCTest framework.\n\n\nUse\n\n\n\n\ndriver.findElement(x)\n\n\n\n\ncall instead of\n\n\ndriver.findElements(x)[0]\n\n\n\n\nto lookup single element by xpath. The more possible UI elements are matched by your locator the slower it is.\n3. Be very specific when locating elements by xpath. Such locators like\n\n\n//*\n\n\n\n\nmay take minutes to complete depending on how many UI elements your application has (e. g.\n\n\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath(\n//XCUIElementTypeButton[@value='blabla']\n))\n\n\n\n\nis faster than\n\n\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath(\n//*[@value='blabla']\n))\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\ndriver.findElement(By.xpath(\n//XCUIElementTypeButton\n)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases it would be faster to perform multiple nested findElement calls than to perform a single call by xpath (e.g.\n\n\n\n\ndriver.findElement(x).findElement(y)\n\n\n\n\nis usually faster than\n\n\ndriver.findElement(z)\n\n\n\n\n\nwhere x and y are non-xpath locators and z is a xpath locator).\n\n\nSystem dependencies\n\n\nIn addition to the many gotchas that might come with upgrading any XCode installation (unrelated to Appium), Appium's XCUITest support requires a new system dependency: \nCarthage\n. Appium Doctor has now been updated to ensure that the \ncarthage\n binary is on your path.\n\n\nAPI differences\n\n\nUnfortunately, the XCUITest API and the UIAutomation API are not equivalent. In many cases (like with \ntap/click\n), the behavior is identical. But some features that were available in the UIAutomation backend are not yet available in the new XCUITest backend. These known lacking features include:\n* Geolocation support (e.g., \ndriver.location\n)\n* Shaking the device\n* Locking the device\n* Rotating the device (note that this is \nNOT\n device \norientation\n, which is supported)\n\n\nWe will endeavor to add these features back in future releases of Appium.\n\n\nScrolling and clicking\n\n\nIn the previous UIAutomation-based driver, if you tried to click on an element that wasn't in view, UIAutomation would scroll to the element automatically and then tap it. With XCUITest, this is no longer the case. You are now responsible for ensuring your element is in view before interacting with it (the same way a user would be responsible for the same).\n\n\nOther known issues\n\n\nFinally, a list of known issues with the initial 1.6 release (we'll strike through issues which have been resolved):\n\n\n\n\nUnable to interact with elements on devices in Landscape mode (https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/6994).\n\n\nshake\n is not implemented due to lack of support from Apple.\n\n\nlock\n is not implemented due to lack of support from Apple.\n\n\nSetting geo-location not supported due to lack of support from Apple.\n\n\nThrough the TouchAction/MultiAction API, \nzoom\n gestures work but \npinch\n gestures do not, due to an Apple issue.\n\n\nThrough the TouchAction/MultiAction API, \nswipe\n gestures are currently not supported, though they should be soon (https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/7573).\n\n\nThe capabilities \nautoAcceptAlerts\n and \nautoDismissAlerts\n do not currently work, and there is continued debate about whether we will be able to implement them in the future.\n\n\nThere is an issue with the iOS SDK such that PickerWheels built using certain API methods are not automatable by XCUITest. See https://github.com/appium/appium/issues/6962 for the workaround, to ensure your PickerWheels are built properly.\n\n\n\n\nAs far as possible, we will add the missing features and fix other known issues in future versions of Appium.",

            "text": "How To Set Up And Customize WebDriverAgent Server\n\n\nAppium for iOS uses \nFacebook's WebDriverAgent\n\nas the automation backend. This backend is based on Apple's XCTest framework and shares all the\nknown problem that are present in XCTest. For some of them we have workarounds, but there\nare some that are hardly possible to workaround, for example https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent/issues/507.\nThe approach described in this article enables you to have full control over how WDA is built, managed,\nand run on the device. This way you may fine-tune your automated tests in CI environment and make them more stable in\nlong-running perspective.\n\n\nImportant points:\n * The steps below are not necessary if default Appium capabilites are used.\n The server will do everything for you, however you won't have so much control over WDA.\n * It is mandatory to have SSH or physical access to the machine to which the device under test\n is connected.\n\n\nWDA Setup\n\n\nWebDriverAgent source is automically downloaded with Appium. The usual folder location\nin case Appium is installed via npm tool (\nnpm install -g appium\n) is\n/usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent\nIf this was a fresh install then it is also necessary to download third-party dependencies\n(\ncarthage\n tool is mandatory for this purpose: \nbrew install carthage\n):\n\n\ncd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent\n./Scripts/bootstrap.sh -d\n\n\n\n\nAlso, it might be necessary to create an empty folder for WDA resources:\n\n\nmkdir -p /usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent/Resources/WebDriverAgent.bundle\n\n\n\n\nNo futher confuguration steps are needed if you're going to execute your automated tests on\niOS Simulator.\n\n\nReal device, however, requires some more work to be done. Follow\n\nreal device configuration documentation\n\nto setup code signing. Also, you'll need to have iproxy tool installed:\n\n\nnpm install -g iproxy\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make sure that WDA source is configured properly:\n\n\n\n\nOpen /usr/local/lib/node_modules/appium/node_modules/appium-xcuitest-driver/WebDriverAgent/WebDriverAgent.xcodeproj\nin Xcode\n\n\nSelect \nWebDriverAgentRunner\n project\n\n\nSelect your real phone/Simulator you'd like to run automated tests on as build target\n\n\nSelect Product-\nTest from the main menu\n\n\n\n\nXcode should successfully build the project and install it on the real device/Simulator,\nso you'll see the icon of WebDriverAgentRunner application on the springboard.\n\n\nWDA Startup\n\n\nWebDriverAgent application acts as a REST server, which proxies external API requests to native XCTest calls\nfor your application under test. The server address will be \nlocalhost\n if you run your tests on Simulator\nor the actual phone IP address in case of real device. We use \niproxy\n to route network\nrequests to a real device from \nlocalhost\n via USB, which means one can use this tool to unify\nWDA network address for Simulator and for real device.\n\n\nThis

This backend is based on Apple's XCTest framework and shares all the\nknown problem that are present in XCTest. For some of them we have workarounds, but there\nare some that are hardly possible to workaround, for example https://github.com/facebook/WebDriverAgent/issues/507.\nThe approach described in this article enables you to have full control over how WDA is built, managed,\nand run on the device. This way you may fine-tune your automated tests in CI environment and make them more stable in\nlong-running perspective.  Important points:\n * The steps below are not necessary if default Appium capabilites are used.\n The server will do everything for you, however you won't have so much control over WDA.\n * It is mandatory to have SSH or physical access to the machine to which the device under test\n is connected.",

Appiums supports NPM version 3+.\n\n\nSetting up Appium from Source\n\n\nAn Appium setup involves the Appium server, which sends messages back and forth\nbetween your test code and devices/emulators, and a test script, written in\nwhatever language binding exists that is compatible with Appium. Run an\ninstance of an Appium server, and then run your test.\n\n\nThe quick way to get started:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/appium/appium.git\ncd appium\nnpm install\nnpm run build\nnode .\n\n\n\n\nHacking on Appium\n\n\nInstall the \nappium-doctor\n tool, and run it to verify all of the\ndependencies are set up correctly (since dependencies for building Appium\nare different from those for simply running it):\n\n\nnpm install -g appium-doctor\nappium-doctor --dev\n\n\n\n\nInstall the Node.js dependencies:\n\n\nnpm install\n\n\n\n\nWhen pulling new code from GitHub, if there are changes to \npackage.json\n it\nis necessary to remove the old dependencies and re-run \nnpm install\n:\n\n\nrm -rf node_modules \n rm -rf package-lock.json \n npm install\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, you will be able to start the Appium server:\n\n\nnode .\n\n\n\n\nSee \nthe server documentation\n\nfor a full list of command line arguments that can be used.\n\n\nHacking with Appium for iOS\n\n\nTo avoid a security dialog that may appear when launching your iOS apps you'll\nhave to modify your \n/etc/authorization\n file in one of two ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManually modify the element following \nallow-root\n under \nkey\nsystem.privilege.taskport\n/key\n\n   in your \n/etc/authorization\n file to \ntrue/\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command which automatically modifies your\n   \n/etc/authorization\n file for you:\n\n\nsudo npm run authorize-ios\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, run:\n\n\nrm -rf node_modules \n rm -rf package-lock.json \n npm install\n\n\n\n\nNow your Appium instance is ready to go. Run \nnode .\n to kick up the Appium server.\n\n\nHacking with Appium for Android\n\n\nTo work on Android, make sure you have \nant\n, \nmaven\n, and \nadb\n installed\nand added to system \nPATH\n environment variable. Also you would need the\nandroid-16 sdk (for \nSelendroid\n) and android-19+ sdk installed.\nFrom your local repo's command prompt, install/run the following:\n\n\nSet up Appium by running:\n\n\nrm -rf node_modules \n rm -rf package-lock.json \n npm install\n\n\n\n\nMake sure you have one and only one Android emulator or device running, e.g.,\nby running this command in another process (assuming the \nemulator\n command is\non your path):\n\n\nemulator -avd \nMyAvdName\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you are ready to run the Appium server via \nnode .\n.\n\n\nMaking sure you're up to date\n\n\nSince Appium uses dev versions of some packages, it often becomes necessary to\ninstall new \nnpm\n packages or update various things. Running \nnpm install\n will\nupdate everything necessary. You will also need to do this when Appium bumps\nits version up. Prior to running \nnpm install\n it is recommended to remove\nall the old dependencies in the \nnode_modules\n directory:\n\n\nrm -rf node_modules \n rm -rf package-lock.json \n npm install\n\n\n\n\nDifferent packages\n\n\nAppium is made up of a number of different packages. While it is often possible\nto work in a single package, it is also often the case that work, whether fixing\na bug or adding a new feature, requires working on multiple packages simultaneously.\n\n\nUnfortunately the dependencies installed when running \nnpm install\n are those that\nhave already been published, so some work is needed to link together local development\nversions of the packages that are being worked on.\n\n\nIn the case where one package, \nA\n, depends on another package, \nB\n, the following steps\nare necessary to link the two:\n1. In one terminal, enter into package \nB\n\n    \ncd B\n\n2. Use \nNPM link\n to create symbolic link to this package\n    \nnpm link\n\n3. In another terminal, enter into package \nA\n\n    \ncd A\n\n4. Use \nNPM link\n to link the dependent package \nB\n to the development version\n    \nnpm link B\n\n\nNow the version of \nB\n that \nA\n uses will be your local version. Remember, however, that\nchanges made to the JavaScript will only be available when they have been transpiled, so\nwhen you are going to test from package \nA\n, run \nnpm run build\n in the directory for\npackage \nB\n.\n\n\nRunning Tests\n\n\nFirst, check out our documentation on \nrunning tests in\ngeneral\n Make sure your\nsystem is set up properly for the platforms you desire to test on.\n\n\nOnce your system is set up and your code is up to date, you can run unit tests\nwith:\n\n\nnpm run test\n\n\n\n\nYou can run functional tests for all supported platforms (after ensuring that\nAppium is running in another window with \nnode .\n) with:\n\n\nnpm run e2e-test\n\n\n\n\nDebugging Node\n\n\nThis project has multiple launch configurations for running NodeJS code from within \nVSCode\n\n\n\n\nDebug\n: Runs Appium server in debug mode so you can set breakpoints inside VSCode source files\n\n\nAttach Debug\n: Attach to a currently running Appium server\n\n\nExample Usage\n\n\nFrom root, run \nnode --inspect-brk . --port 5555\n\n\nRun \nattach debug\n\n\nSetup breakpoints in VSCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTest All\n: Runs all mocha tests in \ntest/\n.

That's it. We want to take all the different useful automation\nengines and smooth away their differences and gotchas by making Appium drivers\nfor them and bringing them under the umbrella of Appium itself. This is very\nsimilar to the goal of the Selenium project. For our part, we want to have\nevery driver be an independent entity (separate repo, tests, etc...) even as it\nuses shared libraries that make the development of an Appium driver as simple\nand boilerplate-free as possible. We use modern JavaScript because JavaScript\nis everywhere and it's easy for many developers to understand and contribute\nback to.\n\n\nDeveloper Community\n\n\nAnyone is welcome to become an Appium developer; just read this guide and get\nsome of your code merged, and you are one of us! If you stick around and help\na lot, we will also make you a committer so that you can continue to help the\ncommunity more easily. If you are developing code for Appium and have\nquestions, reach out to the developer community at\n\nappium-developers@googlegroups.com\n. Note that this is a mailing list for\n\ndevelopment\n questions, not \nusage\n questions or bug reports. Usage questions\nbelong on \ndiscuss.appium.io\n. The GitHub issue\ntracker is for bug reports and feature requests only.\n\n\nAgile Development Workflow\n\n\nThe Appium team runs development according to a very lightweight version of\nSCRUM. Every two weeks we begin a new \"sprint\", or a period of time in which we\nhave decided what we want to accomplish. Anyone familiar with the Appium\ncodebase is welcome to attend our sprint planning and participate as a SCRUM\nteam member for that sprint. No long-term commitments required! During the\nsprint, we update each other with daily progress in the \n#standup\n room in our\n\nAppium Slack Group\n (there are no real-time daily\nstandups). At the end of the sprint, to celebrate our accomplishments and\nreflect on how things went, we hold a \"retrospective\", which might result in\na list of things we can try differently or do better next time around.\n\n\nUltimately, the goal is to time an Appium release at the end of each sprint, so\nevery two weeks. We're not quite there, but hopefully we will be soon.\n\n\nCurrent meeting times:\n* Sprint Planning: every other Monday from 10:00 AM - 10:45 AM (Pacific Time)\n* Sprint Retrospective: every other \nother\n Friday from 1:00 PM - 1:30 PM (Pacific Time)\n\n\nWe hold meetings using \nZoom\n video chat.\n\n\nFor project management, we use the \nZenHub\n browser plugin,\nwhich adds various features like Kanban boards and Epics to the GitHub\ninterface. To fully participate in Appium SCRUM, you'll need to have this\nbrowser plugin installed.\n\n\nIf you are interested in participating a sprint, ping \n@jlipps\n or \n@isaac\n in\nthe Appium Slack Group, or DM \n@jlipps\n on Twitter, and we'll share how to join\nthe video chat for the next sprint.\n\n\nArchitecture\n\n\nAppium is primarily a collection of \nnode.js\n packages that\ncombine to form a running node.js server. These packages are maintained\nindependently of one another and each have their own GitHub repo, CI, and\nrelease process. Some packages (like \nappium-ios-driver\n) are large and add\nsignificant functionality to Appium, while others play a support role and\nexpose one specific bit of functionality that is reused by other packages.\n\n\nFor an overview of the package hierarchy and the role that each package plays,\nplease check out our \npackage\noverview\n doc.\n\n\nTranspilation\n\n\nAppium is written in a new form of JavaScript, called ES6 (or now ES2015).\nBecause this version of the language is not yet supported natively by older\nversions of node.js, Appium code is \ntranspiled\n to ES5 (the more\nwidely-supported version of JS). This transpilation process must occur before\nany code is run. In addition to the new language features of ES6, we have\nadopted two very important keywords from the \nsubsequent\n version of JS, namely\n\nasync\n and \nawait\n, which assist in writing asynchronous code cleanly. Because\nof the transpilation step, Appium packages include tools which watch code for\nchanges and automatically re-transpile the code. Usually, the same tool will\nautomatically run unit tests as well to ensure that nothing small has broken.\nMost Appium packages have this as the default behavior when running \ngulp\n.\n\n\nLinting and Style\n\n\nIt's important for all of Appium's JS to look and feel the same. This includes\nstyle conventions as well as coding patterns and which libraries we use to\nsolve various problems. You should get familiar with our new \nES2015 Style\nGuide\n. When transpiling,\nAppium packages will automatically run ESLint or other lint tools and provide\nwarning or error feedback if the code doesn't conform to our style. These tools\nare not necessarily exhaustive of the kinds of style issues we care about, so\nwe may also mention style issues in our reviews. This isn't to be nit-picky but\nto have a clean, consistent, and readable codebase!\n\n\nSubmitting Code\n\n\nGetting your code into Appium is easy: just submit a PR to one of our repos and\nengage with the maintainers in the review process. We have a number of\nrequirements for code submissions (but don't worry! If the following seems like\na lot, we will helpfully and patiently walk you through each step. Just send in\nyour PR and we'll go from there):\n\n\n\n\nFollow the style of the surrounding code and our Style Guide\n\n\nAtomic commits--one commit per logical change (i.e., make sure that commits don't need to come in a group in order for the program to work. It should work at any given commit). Usually this means one commit per PR. You'll want to get very familiar with \ngit rebase -i\n and squashing!\n\n\nNo merge commits: always rebase on top of latest master (or whatever other branch you're asking to merge into) before submitting your PR.\n\n\nAlmost all changes should have tests. Bugfixes should at the least have unit tests that prove that the bug has been fixed. New features should have unit tests and in most cases e2e tests to prove that the feature actually works. We will be happy to walk you through the test creation process. Reading the surrounding test code is a good place to start. Our CI systems usually run test coverage statistics and we will likely not merge code that decreases test coverage.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do all of these things before submission, your code will almost\ncertainly be accepted very quickly! Of course, if you're thinking of making\na change to Appium that requires a lot of work, you might reach out to the\ndevelopers list to make sure that the change is in line with our philosophy and\nin principle something that we'll accept before you get going.\n\n\nTesting\n\n\nAlways make sure that your changes are tested! In addition to writing unit and\ne2e tests, make sure you run existing tests before you begin to make changes\nand before you push code to be reviewed. We do have CI set up for every Appium\nrepository as a safety net for reviewers to know whether the code they are\nreviewing has passed muster. Running tests in any Appium package is easy!\nUnless the README says otherwise, here are the things you can do:\n\n\nnpm run lint            # run eslint on the code\nnpm run watch           # watch directory to re-transpile on code change, lint, and run unit tests\nnpm run test            # same as above but don't watch\nnpm run e2e-test        # transpile and run end-to-end/functional tests\n_FORCE_LOGS=1 \ncommand\n # show module log output during test run\n\n\n\n\nNote that we have a convention for unit test files to end in \n-specs.js\n and\nfor e2e test files to end in \n-e2e-specs.js\n.\n\n\nReleasing\n\n\nThe release process for any Appium module other than the main Appium package is\npretty straightforward (note that you will need to be an NPM owner for the\npackage if you want to publish it. Ownership is managed by the Appium\ncommitters; talk to @jlipps or @imurchie if you believe you should be an owner\nand are not):\n\n\n\n\nrm -rf node_modules \n rm -rf package-lock.json \n npm install\n and run tests to make sure a clean install works.\n\n\nDetermine whether we have a patch (bugfix), minor (feature), or major (breaking) release according to the principles of \nSemVer\n (see also this explanation of \nhow SemVer works with NPM\n).\n\n\nUpdate the \nCHANGELOG\n and/or \nREADME\n with any appropriate changes and commit. Most subpackages don't have a \nCHANGELOG\n.\n\n\nRun \nnpm version \nversion-type\n with the appropriate version type.\n\n\nPush the appropriate branch to GitHub, and don't forget to include the \n--tags\n flag to include the tag just created by \nnpm version\n.\n\n\nRun \nnpm publish\n (with \n--tag beta\n if this isn't an official release).\n\n\n\n\nFor the main Appium packages, all the above steps must be taken, but with\nseveral changes. One reason is that for the main package we use NPM shrinkwrap\nto ensure dependencies don't change between installations. Another reason is\nthat we develop on master and release on various branches. The way it works is\nas follows: we always develop and add new code to master. When we are ready to\nmake a new minor or major release (i.e., \n1.5.0\n or \n2.0.0\n), we create\na release branch (\n1.5\n or \n2.0\n respectively). We then publish off of that\nbranch. As we feel the need to make patch releases, we first pull the patch\ninto master, then cherry-pick individual patches to the release branch (perhaps\neven multiple release branches). Then we again publish from those branches with\nthe updated patch version (\n1.5.1\n or \n2.0.1\n for example).\n\n\nA note about \nnpm shrinkwrap\n:\n We use \nnpm shrinkwrap\n\nin order to lock dependencies on release. Without it, any development on dependent\npackages will be reflected when Appium is installed, which may lead to issues. Since\nthe configuration file, \nnpm-shrinkwrap.json\n, only exists on release branches,\nit is necessary to manually manage it during the release process. It needs to be\nchecked in to GitHub along with changes to \npackage.json\n. With npm 5+ there is\nalso a \npackage-lock.json\n file produced. During the shrinkwrap process this is\nconverted into the \nnpm-shrinkwrap.json\n file.\n\n\n\n\nRemove the NPM shrinkwrap and package-lock JSON files if they exists.\n\n\nrm -rf node_modules \n npm install\n and run tests to make sure a clean install works.\n\n\nDetermine whether we have a \npatch\n (bugfix), \nminor\n (feature), or \nmajor\n (breaking) release according to the principles of SemVer.\n\n\nUpdate \npackage.json\n with the appropriate new version.\n\n\nUpdate the CHANGELOG/README with appropriate changes and submit for review as a PR, along with shrinkwrap and \npackage.json\n changes. Wait for it to be merged, then pull it into the release branch.\n\n\nRun \nnpm shrinkwrap\n to generate the \nnpm-shrinkwrap.json\n\n\nCreate a tag of the form \nv\nversion\n on the release branch (usually a minor branch like \n1.5\n or \n1.4\n), with: \ngit tag -a v\nversion\n, e.g., \ngit tag -a v1.5.0\n. This is not necessary for beta versions.\n\n\nPush the tag to upstream: \ngit push --tags \nremote\n \nbranch\n\n\nRun \nnpm publish\n (with \n--tag rc\n if this isn't an official release).\n\n\nRemove the NPM shrinkwrap JSON file from Git and push the changes\n\n\nUpdate the site docs by going to https://github.com/appium/appium.io/pulls and merging the latest pull request that was opened by the Triager bot. Close any other pull requests opened by Triager bot.\n\n\nCreate a new release on GitHub: go to \nhttps://github.com/appium/appium/releases/tag/v\nVERSION\n and hit \"Edit Tag\". Make the release name \nVERSION\n (e.g., \n2.0.5\n), then paste in the changelog (but not the changelog header for this version). If it's a beta release, mark as pre-release.\n\n\nCreate a new post on discuss.appium.io announcing the release. Post it in the \"News\" category. Paste in the changelog and any choice comments. Pin it and unpin the previous release post.\n\n\nBegin process of releasing \nappium-desktop\n.\n\n\nNotify @jlipps to so he can tweet a link to the discuss post.",
